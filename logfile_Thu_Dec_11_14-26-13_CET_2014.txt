ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 1th time. The tested sentence is:  They ask her; "what type of music do you make?" "the good kind I hope" she answers.   I first encountered Gretchen Lieberum in the year 1999 or 2000, not sure; on  urlLink mp3.com  and was thrilled when I heard the cover of The bed's too big without you, originally released by The Police. It was nothing like the original, it was pleasant, yet touching; sad, yet made me smile, it was simply amazing. I have always been a fan of ladies singing jazz, acid jazz if possible, and this one lady gave me heaven for 5 minutes and 2 seconds.  I downloaded all of her songs on mp3.com; burned it to a disc (yes I am cheap :)) and that disc didnt leave my discman for at least three or four months, the album was named three a.m. which is the name of one of the songs on the album. The arrangements on the album are really naive, drums, bass, piano, sometimes the trumpet, rhodes piano but the flagship is the vocals, man she is good. The strongest songs in the album are The Bed's too big without you, green apple, jumped the gun and three a.m.; its a must have and I do recommend it strongly. You can check her gigs and her new album (which I havent listened to yet) from her  urlLink homepage urlLink Star Wars Galaxies  This game is one of the best games I have ever played, the catch is, it takes too much time to really enjoy the game, and all I can do is pay the subscription and download the updates once a month... god I hate working.. my girlfriend is going on vacation for a couple of months this summer, I hope to catch up in the meantime, who knows, I might be a jedi (I'm a smuggler right now) the game is a massively multi-player role playing game, people all around the world join in the star wars universe to make the most of it, there are other games like this, such as  urlLink everquest , or  urlLink ultima online  and in the near future, I think  urlLink world of warcraft   is going to be launched, and all three of these are role playing games in  tolkienish world, star wars galaxies, is entirely set in the star wars universe, complete with jedi, storm troopers, rebels and imperials, alongside with the regular folk (neutrals, artisans, mercenaries, bounty hunters etc.) check it out, if you have the time to play that is.. Alexander Selkirk is the name; and this man is indeed the real Robinson Crusoe as Daniel Defoe has written in his book.  Born 1676 in Scotland, Selkirk was a shoemaker and at the age of 19, in 1695 he sailed out to sea after deciding that he had enough of the village life. Within 8 years, he was the captain of his own ship. He then joined the famous pirate William Dampier and in 1704 after getting involved in a quarrel with the captain, he wanted to be dropped off on the inhabited island of Juan Fernandez, which is 400 miles from the coast of Chile.  When stepped foot on the island he had a pound of gun powder, an axe, carpenter tools, clothes, a sleeping bag, the bible etc., while he was eating mussels and waiting for ships to come and rescue him and sleeping at the shore, he got scared of the sea lions and decided to explore the island, and he found drinking water, which was the key to his survival along with the wild goats and wild vegetables. His first major problem was the wild rats attacking during the night time, and he solved that problem by domesticating wild cats. He lit fires to signal ships passing by and the first ones to find him were the Spanish which were at war with England at that time. Selkirk had to flee to depth of the island twice to escape the Spanish soldiers who saw his signal and came to check it out. He was milking his tamed goats, gardening and raising crops, reading the bible loud not to lose his ability to speak; after a while he had ran out of gunpowder, his clothes and shoes were torn and battered but running after goats all the time had made him an expert hunter and walking on granite all the time had made his feet strong enough to walk barefoot all the time and the leather from his goats provided him the necessary materials that he needed to make basic clothing, isolation to keep his quarters warm and bedding. After about a year the island gave everything that Selkirk could possibly ask for. He was rescued in 1709 by a captain named Woodes Rogers whose ship belonged to a company which belonged to the same Dampier who had left him on that island 5 years ago. Despite his isolation he was given the title of lieutenant and then promoted to captain later. He returned to England in 1711, lived in Scotland for a while, got married, then returned back to sea and died from yellow fever at the age of 45 at sea, somewhere on the west coast of Africa.  The island of Juan Fernandez is known as the The Island of Robinson Crusoe, has a population of 700 and the locals are mainly occupied with lobster hunting, the island next to that was named Alexander Selkirk; both islands are territory of Chile, the town of Largo Scotland has a statue of Selkirk and his parents graves are still in the graveyard and are a tourist attraction. most musicians today use commercial instruments i.e. an instrument that was designed by a group of designers, developed by engineers, built by cheap laborers in the far east and sold by shark music stores to kids and people who are too lazy to investigate options and/or have plenty of money to spend.  it's ok for a person I think to own a commercial instrument of course, what difference does it make anyway if you're a weekend warrior with a day-job and a family and you practice in your bedroom/basement/garage etc. and play at the local pub every once in a while.  but for people who really want the genuine thing (and they can too be weekend warriors with a hungry ear for good sounding gear) having a guitar built could prove to be very rewarding (or building one themselves given that they have the talent, the courage and the time-resources-money etc.).  there are loads of custom guitar builders on the internet; a simple search of "custom guitar building" returns 155,000 results in google as of today. So we do indeed have enough resources.  What I am going to discuss here is how to make the most of the experience of building your own guitar. when I say building, I of course dont mean that you cut the tree, forge the hardware, wind the pickups and build it from scratch, there are loads of companies who supply the necessary parts. The first example I can give is  urlLink warmoth  which is a company based in washington-USA; they specialize in building superior guitar parts, and they carry most of the hardware such as bridges, frets, pickups etc.  If we were to make our own guitar, the first step would probably be to make a feasibility research. Lets say the project guitar is a fender stratocaster type guitar, with fancy features. First lets see how much it costs to go buy the guitar from a store which carries the features we would want; lets see, I would like a locking tremolo, nice machine heads, jumbo frets, a rosewood fingerboard, an ash body, preferably one piece (which would produce a thick, rich sound because it is one piece and does not have any glue holding any parts together) nice electronics ( a shielded pickguard, which will help reduce the 60hz hum that is likely to emerge) quality pickups (lets say a humbucker for the bridge and two single coils for the mid and neck positions) a nice finish, and of course expert craftmanship, hand built if possible.  If you were to order this guitar from fender themselves, they would probably redirect you to their custom shop; lets see one guitar that I found which was listed for $2479 but was being sold for $1735 at  urlLink music123.com ; the specs are: alder, 3 pieces glued together; Vintage Style 2-Point Synchronized Tremolo with Stamped Solid Steel Saddles and Milled Solid Steel Block; rosewood fingerboard, maple neck, Machine Heads: Nickel/Chrome, Sperzel Trim-LokÂ® Staggered Tuning Machines; 22 frets, a gold anodized aluminum pickguard, cobalt blue transparent finish, gloss on neck, hot noisless bridge pickup and vintage noiseless pickups on the neck and middle positions. You can see the guitar itself  urlLink here .  Now lets try to build the same quailty, if not better guitar by using only warmoth, which by the way is not one of the cheapest companies on the market, you can probably get a better deal on parts if you do some  urlLink research  here goes the parts and prices body: one piece swamp ash with a contoured heel (which lets you have a better grip of the higher frets on the neck) and a transparent blue gloss: $405 neck: maple with rosewood fingerboard, double expanding truss rod, fender strat headstock, clear gloss finishing: $192 bridge: Gotoh Wilkinson Tremolo; chrome; $89, includes everything necessary to mount it. tuning pegs :Schaller Mini Locking Tuners; chrome : $48 for the full set.  input jack: chrome strat plate, Planet Waves gold plated stereo jack with multiple contact points; $16 set of knobs (volume-tone-tone): standard strat, white; $6 humbucker mounting rig: chrome: $7.50 plate (for the joint where the neck joins the body): chrome $4.50 pots: 1 500k for volume, one 250k for the mid-neck tone and one push and pull for the bridge which lets us do coil splitting, totals up to: $17 screws of all kinds: pickup, pickguard, bridge, tremolo etc: $10, all chrome. schaller locking strap holders: $12 chrome LSR roller nut (which has little iron balls which let the string slide when bended) $40 chrome. set of string retainers with the chrome bar; $10 5 way switch for the pickups: $12 copper shielding tape; about $5 for the whole pickguard wiring: $5.95 standard white pickuard, drilled for our choice of pickups, bridge and switches-knobs $20 Now this all totals up to $905 ; plus I will add another $100 just in case; what does that total? $1005; lets buy a case for the guitar for another $100; thats $1100 to round up.  Now the last thing we need to add is the pickups; you can buy good pickups from companies like seymour duncan for about $50-$60 each; or buy custom wound, boutique ones which could be more expensive or cheaper than widely commercial pickups from manufacturers like  urlLink lindy fralin ,  urlLink bill lawrence  etc. lets say we buy a set of seymour duncan, an alnico 2 humbucker for the bridge and two single coil vintage's for the neck and mid positions (and a reminder, these arent the best set you can buy for the price, you can get a full set from bill lawrence for about $130-but it will take about a month and a half for them to reach you) and that totals to something like $200 and the final subtotal would be $1300; now we have all the parts and we need to get them assembled; now you can do this yourself, if you have the patience and/or experience etc; but what I would suggest is to get help from a luthier, or a guitar technician, i.e. someone who has done work similar to this. Lets assume we pay the luthier a good $200 for an afternoons work (since there is no finishind, glueing etc. its only putting the parts together and turning some screws) and that totals up to $1500 doesnt it, now thats still about $300 cheaper than the custom shop fender, plus it is way way better in terms of build material, sound and personality; first of all I would name my guitar emrahcaster (lame yes, but its my guitar, I can name it anything I like can't I?) the drawbacks of building your own guitar could be the time being involved, the research you have to do, labor, waiting for parts to be produced which can take up to a couple of months in some cases, and the possibility that you don't like the end product (which would basicly be the fault of the wrong selection of parts and/or builders, not yours entirely) but in my opinion it definitely is worth taking the risk and imagine that the outcome is a beauty, I guess I would be as proud as I could be.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 2th time. The tested sentence is:  Hi, my name's Steve and I've just entered the world of blogdom. But like a child, cluelessly born into the big wide world, this blog-birth was not a matter of choice. So thank you to Brother Andrew (a monk I once met in Devon) for setting this up and forcing it upon me without my realising, I'm sure it will provide me with many hours of fun. Even if nobody else finds it quite so entertaining.  All I can say is watch this space...theres gonna be some changes around here.  PS. If you want to see Brother Andrew's own personal blog, go to  urlLink andyandshona.blogs.com urlLink      urlLink      Au Revoir & Auf Wiedersehen. Suddenly the world seems a better place! urlLink      The picture says it all. urlLink       Just 24 hours to go til we're all subjected to another 90 minutes of nail biting, as England face hosts Portugal in the Euro 2004 Quarter Finals. Recently Sven's men have made watching a Tim Henman Wimbledon match seem like a stroll in the park, and rollercoaster rides such as the France and Croatia games have certainly added a grey hair or two to my head. Fortunately wins against Switzerland and Croatia have seen Becks & Co through the group stage, largely thanks to the formidable form of Master/Sir/King(delete as appropriate)Rooney.  Tomorrow night could be a tough match and the England defence must improve on recent games if they are to tame the likes of Figo, Ronaldo and Deco. Still...we've got Beckham, Gerrard, Lampard, Owen, and of course...ROONEY!!! So who is there to fear? Nobody at all. So, COME ON ENGLAND!   PUNDIT STEVE PREDICTS: England 2 (Rooney, Owen) Portugal 1 (Ronaldo) urlLink       Well after a week of sun, sand and scrumptious food I have returned to a wet, windy and woeful England. (Well, maybe 'woeful' is a bit much, but I couldn't think of anything else beginning with W!) I had a brilliant holiday in Northern Cyprus, unfortunately for the locals it was so hot they were punished with the sight of my legs for a week as the shorts, t-shirts and flip-flops remained permanent fixtures. I'm sure there will be some more holiday snaps on here soon, including possibly one or two of me jumping off a 2,500 foot high mountain......! urlLink       Its definitely a case of the morning after the night before for me today, as I recover from a fantastic evening of music, drink, food and fun. Last night I played guitar at an acoustic gig at the Kerith Centre, Bracknell, and a great time was had by all. One of my regular bands (pictured) were the final act of the evening, we stripped things down a bit from our usual set to suit the unplugged vibe, and even changed our name for the event from Rod, Jane & Freddy to The Matt Price Band (guess who's idea that was?!).   Things started off well as our customary pre-gig Big Mac Meals went down a treat (thanks Ronald), while The Nexus Band and Rosie Donnan provided the nights early entertainment. Finally, after an interval and a buffet (more food!), it was our turn to take the stage. It was a decent performance on our behalfs, and it was great to have an extra backing vocalist and violinist as special guests for the gig. 120 people went home happy having seen and heard some brilliant acoustic music, all with a great message of faith, hope and love.   Tomorrow I am off to Cyprus for seven days in the sun, so make sure you don't miss those holiday snaps on my return next week! urlLink     Carrying the hopes of a nation   After weeks of counting down, today marks the start of Euro 2004. Hosts Portugal kick things off against Greece this evening, while the one we've all been waiting for is just a day away. The 23 smart looking Englishmen and the 1 greying Swede above are genuinely thought to have a real chance of success this summer, but possibly the toughest test of all awaits them tomorrow night as they face France in their opening match. Expect a fascinating battle in the middle of the field as superstars Zidane, Vieira, Pires and Makelele take on the formidable Gerrard, Beckham, Scholes and Lampard. This should be a tight game and may be decided by just the one goal, so COME ON ENGLAND! YOU CAN DO IT!

Baddiel and Skinner are back on the couch to bring us plenty of comical Euro 2004 action, and they started with a bang this evening. There were plenty of Big Ron jokes, David Seaman's Euro 96 penalty save against Scotland in Phoenix From The Flames, and of course the legendary Statto! If you never saw the show during its day make sure you don't miss out again this time, if you were a fan of this in the mid-1990s remember its on ITV now, not BBC2! urlLink       Well it may have taken quitting my job to finally find a bit of spare time, but my temporary unemployment seems to have been a blessing in disguise. As you will see this blog has at last been updated (its amazing what a free afternoon can do!), and rest assured there is more to come. Until then, enjoy this particularly soothing picture of me relaxing with a nice cold pint of Grandpa's old cough medicine. urlLink      Yes, the rumours are true...I have finally realised a lifelong dream and met a great hero of mine, Mr Ronald McDonald. Massive respect to the big man for taking some time out from his busy burger making schedule to have a chat and pose for this special photo. Over the years this man has provided me and my stomach with an immeasurable amount of pleasure. So Ronald, thank you. urlLink     Apparently, the devil has all the best tunes. The New York Post once declared,  "Most Christian rock ranks right up there with the great plagues of the Bible, including rivers turning into blood, frogs raining from the sky, and those nasty angels of death" . For decades the very term 'rock' has been synonymous with sex, drugs, violence and all kinds of rebellious abuse.   Recently I read  urlLink 'Faith, God & Rock 'n' Roll' by Mark Joseph,  a book exploring the links between notions of modern music and spirituality, particularly Christianity. The fascinating accounts and comments within have helped reinforce and reinspire my belief that God can speak through music of all kinds, and is in fact doing so more and more within the contemporary worlds of rock and pop. Joseph observes and discusses the recent pattern whereby bands and musicians of faith have ignored the familiar and comfortable, yet often substandard and horrendously inward-looking Christian music scene; favouring the contemporary side of the industry - a tougher nut to crack, but a significantly wider audience to entertain.   By looking at bands/artists such as POD, Lauryn Hill, U2, Mary Mary, Creed and Sixpence None The Richer to name just a few, this book focuses on a handful of the acts to have broken into American charts with a spiritual message, yet a popular and relevant sound. The pattern is of course the same here in England, where we have witnessed the likes of Daniel & Natasha Bedingfield and Athlete invading the airwaves with the sorts of open beliefs that would have once been confined to strictly religious settings. Naturally, the shift is creating plenty of controversy and alarm from both sides of the camp. Religious quarters have expressed their concern at the willingness of people of faith to throw themselves into an apparently dangerous, evil setting; while hardened music lovers have questioned the supposed contradictions that exist between rock and religion - suggesting that those who combine the two either have a hidden agenda, or are simply fakes.   As a music loving Christian, I see it this way: firstly, God has told us to be  'in the world, but not of it'  - in other words to avoid 'worldly' or unholy ways of doing things, but certainly not distancing ourselves so much so that we cannot relate to the world any more. In bypassing the Christian music scene artists are rejecting a market that sometimes alienates itself from popular society, preferring their work to be heard by a larger, predominantly non-Christian audience - therefore  in the world , the challenge is then to not be  of it . Secondly, music is for everyone and therefore anyone should be able to produce it. To cast doubt over the legitimacy of music made by spiritual people for perhaps non-spiritual settings is not only restricting, but ultimately ignorant. For a band to be judged on anything other than their music is a bizarre concept, does the type of cereal our musicians prefer to eat affect our judgement over them as artists? So why should a personal belief in God harm someone's credibility within the music scene?   Ultimately, rock is about rebellion. And what greater rebellion than to refuse to conform to the predetermined ways of a supposedly non-conformist genre?   I accept that I may not have got it all right on this topic, so I'm interested in other peoples views on whether music/rock can or should be allowed to mix with religion or Christianity. Please feel free to leave any comments. Some other interesting faith/music views can be read on this thread I found on the  urlLink Drowned In Sound  message board, and this comment on a blog by  urlLink The Shiny Headed Prophet .   Discuss! The time has come, oh yes. Almost 2 weeks ago I begged you not to miss what was coming; 1 week ago I kept you in suspense like a Friday evening Neighbours cliffhanger - by boasting of my near death experience. Now as promised, I can proudly present the eagerly awaited Steve Scott Paragliding Photos!   Running off the edge of a 2,500 foot high mountain in Northern Cyprus has to go down as one of the sillier things I have done in life, but surely one of the most exciting! Anyone who's done it before will understand what I am saying, it was an incredible feeling to be so high up in the air, legs dangling, supported only by a few strings! A must-do experience. But enough of the small talk, enjoy the photos.    urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink     Thanks very much to  urlLink Brother Andrew  for his help with the photos urlLink      Its official! Watford FC were last night crowned champions of Ibiza after winning the prestigious (well, it is now!) Copa de Ibiza trophy. The Hornets succeeded where Beckham et al failed, by winning a penalty shoot out 5-4 to claim the title, having drawn 1-1 with Sheffield Wednesday after 90 minutes. Earlier in the tournament Watford disposed of Ibiza's finest side Portmany 4-1 en route to European glory.    Unfortunately this incredible triumph is not quite ranked highly enough to provide the mighty Golden Boys with a somewhat deserved automatic qualification for this years Champions League, but it sets us up nicely for this seasons inevitable cup and league quadruple: Copa de Ibiza, FA Cup, Worthington Cup (is it still called this these days?!), and the even more ridiculously named Coca Cola Championship (it'll always be "Division One...the old Division Two" to me!) urlLink      Part 2 of the Northern Cyprus holiday snaps features myself as Captain Steve! Yes, they really did let me have a go at controlling this boat and putting the lives of 11 or 12 innocent people at risk. However, there was one event earlier in the week when 23 years of being me flashed before my eyes in a moment, and my life really was at risk! Fortunately for you this moment was captured on camera, and sometime next week I will be displaying some of those pictures on here as promised. So watch this space! Its been almost 2 weeks since I returned from my holiday in Kyrenia, North Cyprus, so definitely about time you saw a few of my holiday snaps. Consider these merely a starter, something to whet the appetite - as very soon you will be treated to the main course, the real thing. The photos you see now are good, pleasant shots.

It's about a lot of different things, but it's mainly about preservation.  Preservation of the lifestyles we enjoy and the music we embrace.  There is a general problem with the suburbs, and that's the mentality.  The fact that the people in the city have things to worry about if we fuck up our surroundings.  I live on 14th and Park, about two blocks from downtown, If I look out my window I can see the problems caused by the assholes that run to the sticks to live in their nice houses with gardeners and friendly mailpersons.  Fuck that.  I like anonymity.  I am a people person, don't get me wrong, but that's exactly the thing I hated about high-school, college, and pretty much all of St. Cloud.

I got a few good fortune cookies lately, which is good, if you're into superstition or luck or whatever.  One was,"You will always get what you want through your charm and personality.".  Another was something like, "your body is for use, not abuse."  which I kinda take issue with.  Where do Body Modifications fall?  Use?  Abuse?  Is decoration of the only tangible thing you will ever truly own abuse, or just proper use?  Is skateboarding and falling down a million times before you actually get the trick right abuse?  Or are you just doing what your body is allowing you to do, being as it regenerates the damage (assuming it isn't irreparable)?  Of all the fortunes I got, they really should just be called wisdom cookies, The best one was, "To understand, listen beneath the words.".  Now that's wisdom, and with wisdom, hopefully comes good fortune. Lately it has come to my attention that I am a little uptight.  maybe not uptight to the point of like, cataloging all my shoes and socks for easy access, but uptight enough to blow up on some fool for no reason.  To those I have been hostile to, I am sorry.  With that out of the way, on to matters of the heart.  Work today was normal.  A good laugh session raises morale I think.  I saw a sign on the street today that said Killme Electric.  That has a nice ring to it.  Also, I'm looking to move out of the basement soon, and quit starbucks.  I hate it.  The employees are all so cold all the time. I come in late.  I dispise it.  Maybe Dunn Bros. will hire me. My name, Magic Brad, was stolen.  Not in the respect that I had it and someone bit me, admittedly I bit it from someone else.  The main difference here is that he is an actual magician, where as I just thought is sounded cool.    So now I wonder, are magicians violent people?  Should I fear for my life?  Will I wake up one day and be sawed in half?  Impaled upon a dozen swords?  or maybe he'll just make me vanish entirely.  But then where would I go when I was gone? I just remembered I never explained the buddy power twins.  They are these two little matchbox guys who, when you push down their heads, scream "let's help someone!"  or "let's dig it!"  or "Buddy power!".  They replaced the Potato Head and so far they've been a rousing success.  Time will only tell at this point whether or not they too will find themselves in that big action-figure heaven in the sky.... This morning I woke up all bright and early, only to feel super shitty, and ultimately vomit while attempting to shower.  Needless to say, I took another shower.  There's this toy.  It's a Mr. Potato Head that talks.  It says terribly stupid things, over and over and over again.  That's where the name of this blog came from.  One day at work, Colin and I were trying to figure out how to make the thing work, because up until now it had been on the demo mode and no one had actually played the game, which was some sort of Simon Says rip-off.  So we get him to work, but not before having to push the same button and hear the same five words incessantly.  "I know what you're thinking...." said the Potato Head.  How pretentious!  If he already knew that, he would have shut up in order to save his own life.  "I bet you've never heard a talking potato before." he said, and I must admit, he was right.  In the end, he did get what was coming to him.  Just as we figured out how to play the game, he was thrown away by our assistant manager.  Fortunately, he was replaced by the Buddy Power Brothers! So anyways, I'm at work today and a fellow co-worker and I get this sudden impulse for mischief.  There's always no shortage of crappy toys at our disposal, so we took this little plastic figure of The Ultimate Warrior, you know, the wrestler, and decided to light him on fire.  We went out back to the loading dock and put only the tiniest of flames to Mr. Warrior's hands, but within seconds the small plastic steroid-riddled action figure was fully engulfed in flames.  Really, if he had maybe even gotten to close to a barbeque or someone had used a magnifying glass on him, it prolly would have had the same result.  How safe are your children? I got promoted at my job, I'm an ass man now.  I seem to get lotsa ass man positions.  Hmmm.  That didn't sound right.  anyways, it's windy and blue outside, and I finished Bomb the Suburbs, so now I'm reading No More Prisons, by the same author.  here's an excerpt from a cool song by Alexisonfire called "Counterparts and number them."  Jennifer, they lied to you when they said you couldn't breath underwater. I lied to when I said I was hard, because I'm softer than a thrift store sweater and twice as worn in. I was cast away once but I will be found again. This I promise you.   how fun! They Might Be Giants are coming to MPLS someitme in the next month.  For anyone who is interested.  Also, They did a song on Homestarrunner.com. It's about tropical laserbeams, whatever the hell that means.  Anyways, I've been riding Motorcycles all day because I had part 2 of the safety class today.  It was fun. we got to stop real fast and skid and stuff.  More practice tomorrow and then.... dun dun dunnnnnnnn.....the TEST!  Everyone wish me luck, I'd do the same for you if you had a blog and were taking your morotcycle beginner safety course.  That was a mouthful.  Speaking of mouths being full, I'm off to have Jim Beam and supper.  Not in that order. Piece. I have moved.  I am mostly completely moved in, save for a few unmentionables.  Conan has been a repeat for the past few nights and I'm upset.  I've seen them all.....now I want new stuff.  Blasted radiowaves, seeping into my subconscious, making me crave Conan.  There may be some kind of housewarming party sometime in the next weeks, so I'll keep those invited posted.  Here's a tricky question:  How do you go about inviting those people whom you want to be at your party, to your party, while there are elements of unfavorable riff-raff around?  Do you invite them privately?  The other guy isn't a bad guy, you just don't want him coming to your party, getting drunk, as is his fashion, and vomiting in your fish tank....again.  So you are left to think,"Am I just a snob?  Should I invite guy, even though he's a slobbering drunk?  Maybe mail invites?" and meanwhile the one person you did face-to-face invite is telling the unfavorables that you don't plan to invite them.  Now you've fucked yourself.  I hope your happy.  P.S. Come to my party. I've got some kinda cold, and it sucks.  On the other hand, It made me lie in bed and watch an entire documentary about a woman who lost her father in Vietnam, before she was old enough to remember him.  If this strikes your interest, check it out at: http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/begoodsmilepretty/ Be Good, Smile Pretty is a film by Tracy Droz Tragos, and a very good one at that.  So I suppose Memorial Day this year did teach me something.  Also I watched Larry King Live, something I usually can't stand doing, Becuase It was a tribute to the late great Johnny Cash. Very interesting indeed.  Have a nice couple of days, as gloomy as it is, and I'll type at you soon. There's this new  urlLink Caribou Coffee   drink, that is mixed with Reese's PB Cups.  Really, it's terrible, but the prospect of a PB flavored coffee drink was very interesting to me.  There are several things that are interesting to me as of late.  I will delve deeper.  The dastardly  urlLink DFL .  I say this because they have been trying very hard to get people to vote by standing outside of every  urlLink yuppie   urlLink hipster  bar/coffee shop for months now.  I can respect the effort.  I know plenty of people who need a little political nudge.  However, the  urlLink Green party  does not get the same respect.  I'm a firm believer of truth in advertising, and to go out posting up flyers that say "Summer Jobs!  Defeat Bush!"  and barely telling people that it's for the green party seems kinda shady.   urlLink GreenPeace  did sort of the same thing.  They had people standing outside the yipster bars/coffee shops,  but when passers-by got too annoyed with them, they changed the color of their shirts and moved across the street.  Bastards.  At least just admit that you're annoying, you know?  Don't try to mislead me.  That just makes you three times as irritating.  to be continued...... Hello anyone.  I know it's been awhile, but now iI can plug in to the Interweb-netter at work, so I can get things back to normal.  I'm working on a project right know that I need some input on.  Back to School sale coming up, and we need to post up flyers at various hotspots around the city.  Any suggestions?  Where do high school kids hang out?  College kids?  Maybe bars or coffee houses?   Mostly, I need some clever insight as to what to write on said flyers.  Like, catchy one liners and pictures of cool and/or inspiring people or fancy landscape scenes.   If anyone has any good Ideas, e-mail me please.   urlLink Leonjuju@hotmail.com  .     My friend  urlLink Colin  is spending time in the  urlLink Faroe Islands .  I hear it's nice there this time of year.  Actually, I hear they like to randomly start dancing, singing and conversing late into the evening.  He explains it better than I.  Just look for yourself. As a side note, if anyone is interested in  urlLink Beaded Jewelery , check out this site.  It's a former co-worker and a friend, who shall remain unnamed and unscolded for not visiting.     Guess it's back to work.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 4th time. The tested sentence is:  In the words of my generation, "Hello World". This is my first log in this BLOG. I think it is only apt for me to explain what the hell a BLOG is, for the benefit of the those who might be scratching their head everytime they hear that word. A BLOG is a slang for Weblog. It's kinda like an online journal. The first thing that it reminded me was Doogie Howser MD. In my opinion expressing one's self is a healthy routine. Specially for the depressed, the stressed, the people who just like to speak in the third person point of view.  After surfing for the whole day in the office, I finally found something worthwhile to do. I'll be updating this BLOG as often as I can. So if you are interested in me, or in my mishaps, visit it every once in a while. I look forward to my next log. Ciao. Someone once told me that the time you really miss someone is when that person is right there in front of you. I find it to be quite ironic and disturbingly true altogether. Perhaps what they are referring to is a yearning for someone else. A side or a psyche of the person they are with. Or worse, they fear that the effects of being in such close proximity with someone they hold so dear is about to end. And so they anticipate the inevitable aftermath.  I came to realize that when you say I miss you to someone, what you are actually saying is I donâ€™t want you to go. Or I want you to stay. Or I donâ€™t want this to end. Funny isnâ€™t it? How people canâ€™t say directly what is aching in their hearts. I, among many people have the knack of making simple things complicated. I now find myself asking questions. What if, tomorrow becomes next week? And Next week becomes next month? And next month becomes forever? Will I ever find the answers I seek? As always I find the answers emotionally disturbing.  Exactly how long has it been since I was last with her? Twelve days 2 hours 4 seconds and 2 heartbeats have passed. As I am writing this entry, I am comforted that the long wait is finally over. I no longer care about the past. And tomorrow doesnâ€™t seem as important than today. There is only now. And so now I yearn. urlLink    Melvin at work  urlLink If there has been anything new this week, it's that I've been silent in the past few days. I guess I went overboard going senti mode during the last few days. Sometimes, in our attempt to make the people around us feel special we fail to consider what matters most. As said in the "Little Prince", what is essential is invisble to the naked eye. This week I lost track of what was essential. And it has changed my life forever.   I now try to be more sensitive on the little things. For sometimes they are more significant than what we perceive to be of importance. Because of my failure, I seek refuge in the silence of my solitude. Here I lay and reflect on what I have missed, on what I have done. And I am comforted by the peace of silence. Sometimes you need to be alone to realize these things. Because in acknowledging your failures you come about to the conclusion that you are responsible for the things you do. You were a part of the failure. There was something that you could have done. Ergo you are still in control of your life. And you live with the promise that you still have the chance to fix the mistakes you have made.  My friends have been telling me that I am too quiet in my approach in a lot of things. They say that it is not good. I will appear weak and people will try to dominate me. I will be unable to impress people if I sulk in silence. In my defense, why ruin silence? When silence is the language I use to express how I feel. I can get rowdy sometimes. I can be loud if i want to be, specially when I am mad. But it is when I am silent when I savor every moment that passes by. It is in silence where I thank God for the chance and when I pray for the moment never to end.  Enough about the my melodramatic sentimental babbling. I have posted several new mp3's in the yahoo briefcase. This time Maureen is the one who is singing. It's a lot cleaner and smooth. Perfect for this weeks entry. But it also means that the songs are more simple and others may say bland. You may say that it's also no good. But it was hard for me to set it up so backoff.. Hehehehehe. I do appreciate the posts from friends who drop by and make entries in the tag board. For requests, inquiries and complaints just make your mark on the tag board on the right side of this page. I'd like to dedicate the last song i uploaded to 2 people. To Abbie, mau's best friend and to ate shawie who is going to be celebrating her birthday soon. The title of the song is "One of these days" by michelle branch. Cheers! They say that year 25 in a person's life is a huge milestone worth of commemoration. I dont get it. What's the hype about being 25. Do I have a car, no. Do I have live on my own, hell no. Am I in a relationship, dont say bad words. Hehehehehe.  They say that the rest of the populace start stopping counting birthdays at age 25. I can remember the cake prepared by my officemates this morning. They just had 1 candle. They say that after 25, you start using only one candle in your birthday cake. Otherwise the neighbors might think there's fire in your house because of the number of candles in your cake if you have one for each year that has passed.   While the rest of the world is asking themselves about success and career at this point in their life. Im gratefull to have reached this age. I look back and just laugh at all my failures and awkward experiences. I have grown. I think what's more significant was God has given me a chance to grow. 25 years of it. And so I move on. Living life without regrets.  For our webcast fans check our yahoo briefcase account. I have uploaded new mp3's. A cleaner version of my Immortal, Officially Missing you(with the twins haplessly trying to do a duet) and You First Believed. Enjoy. Good day friend. As promised I am haplessly trying to keep this weblog as updated as possible. Though there is not much to say about the days that has passed by, there has been a lot of development.  For quite sometime now, I've been seriously contemplating in making crucial decisions in my career. New ventures, possibilities and challenges. Im kinda takin it easy in the last few months.         Specially that I've already started going to graduate school, things are not looking financially stable for me. It's a good thing I have great friends and a loving family who supported me in this endeavor.          I have also been trying to get to know this special someone. And I have no idea where I stand as far chances are concerned. So far the approach has been to be more relaxed, carefree and non idealistic. I have realized that in my past approaches in courting, I have often imprisoned myself in the cages of ideals and fantasies. I guess, I wasnt myself. I dont plan, I improvise. Hehehehe. So far it doesnt look good for me. It seems that Im not the only one who has been wooed by the goddess who has been driving me mad these past few days.      As promised to our webcast acoustic fans I am posting here some URL's for our mp3's. For now , all I have are some jamming sessions. I'll be updating the links later, to have a more decent recording. But for now, I guess this will have to do. A picture of things to come. Go to  urlLink yahoo briefcase  . Login as "next_of_kin2000" with password "fetalvero". Click on My Documents link to download the mp3's available.        As you can see I've been very busy in the past few days. Too many risks, choices, and things to be done. I figured, if I dont start trying I'll never get anywhere. If I dont make decisions, take risks and learn from them, i'll never find out. If I have a future else where, if I can survive graduate school, if me and my sisters can excel as a band and if she's the one. So I guess this week I'll be trying. Someone once noticed that I had new  shoes. Contrary to popular belief, I wear my shoes not to drive away fashion savvy and interesting people. I am very sentimental about these things. Most of my shoes were given to me by my dad.  It's a link between me and him . We dont get to talk a lot. But as far as I can remember he has always been giving me shoes since I was a kid. So it reminds me of my dad. The lessons he has taught me. What he has done for me and my family. Often times I look down. Specially when I have failed.When I am tired and weary. And I see my shoes. I am reminded by the places I've been. The things I have done. And the people who care and believe in me. It's funny how small things such as this can brighten up one's day. urlLink    Melvin and sisters  urlLink This week melvin reflects on things he actually said(or at least he thought he said):  "I'd rather go and lookback, than to stay and watch you walk away."  "Ahhh to love! Tis trading one pain for another"  "There are doctors for these kinds of things!!"  "There came a time in my life, when someone took my idea of the perfect girl, destroyed it, and replaced it with her picture."  "I am not sensitive. Im just very sentimental."  "I dont like her! I love her! There's a difference.  It just so happened that I cant post anything worth seriously contemplating during the weekdays. But the blog page was calling me. Must write something. Until my next entry. Ciao. Melvin's Wonder Years  urlLink     urlLink urlLink    melvin's new header So I find my back against the wall. Iâ€™m getting more paranoid everyday. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s worse, knowing too much or not knowing anything at all. Many times I have found things not going in my favor. Failures, mistakes seem to be a common thing to me now. And yet I canâ€™t help but feel upset whenever things donâ€™t work out for me.  A friend once told me, in life we have been pre programmed with the idea that with every action comes an equal reaction. Causality suggests that for everything you do there is an equivalent result. And so we go to school with the idea that if we graduate, we have a better chance on landing on a good job. We work, knowing that if we do our job well weâ€™ll make a living or get a raise. But not everything in life has to be like that. In fact, the most essential concept in life does not adhere to the rule of causality. And so we see many people struggling with it. Love, does not follow the rules of action and reaction. At least not strictly. When you love someone, there is no guarantee that you will be loved in return.  When you court someone, it does not endow the person you are courting to respond to your actions. So when you are looking for results, for responses and for reasons, donâ€™t look for it in love. Least youâ€™ll find the understanding it as a very daunting task. For people who get by, they immediately try to accept that Love is something that you cannot understand. It is beyond you and me. It does not conform to any norms or rules. In short do not waste your time trying to understand something that can never be understood.   And so I ask myself why invest my feelings on something that is not certain? Something that I cannot fathom or understand. The answer is simple. I do so because of hope. In life as well as in love, nothing is for certain. There is no assurance that everything will run smooth as planned. Things can go wrong. People get hurt. But it is hope that shall see you through all these trials. â€œIt is hope that drives me through the day, and more importantly hope that sees me through the night. It is through hope, that love shall lead me back to you.â€?.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 5th time. The tested sentence is:  This will be the last entry till the next time when i come home from camp. i guess i will miss those i care for and love and i hope that while i am gone, they make a possitive change in their lives. Guys i wish you all the best and i want you to know that i love you guys. i hope to see you soon. And If there are those who are down and depressed, go listen to a song called "That Thing You Do" by The Wonders. it worked very much for me. Frankly i leave in tears as it is hard to part with you guys but i guess i have to do my part which i had promised someone a long time ago, to work hard and try to make decent money for the family. Although we are no more together, it is just something that i have to do. Pray for me felles. Keep the faith.    Russel Watson - Where My Heart Will Take Me  (Theme from TV series Enterprise, also known as Faith Of the Heart)  Lyrics by Diane Warren   It's been a long road, getting from there to here.  It's been a long time, but my time is finally near.  And I can feel the change in the wind right now. Nothing's in my way.  And they're not gonna hold me down no more, no they're not gonna hold me down.   Cause I've got faith of the heart.  I'm going where my heart will take me.  I've got faith to believe. I can do anything.  I've got strength of the soul. And no one's gonna bend or break me.  I can reach any star. I've got faith, faith of the heart.   It's been a long night. Trying to find my way.  Been through the darkness. Now I finally have my day.  And I will see my dream come alive at last. I will touch the sky.  And they're not gonna hold me down no more, no they're not gonna change my mind.   Cause I've got faith of the heart.  I'm going where my heart will take me.  I've got faith to believe. I can do anything.  I've got strength of the soul. And no one's gonna bend or break me.  I can reach any star. I've got faith, faith of the heart.   I've known the wind so cold, I've seen the darkest days.  But now the winds I feel, are only winds of change.  I've been through the fire and I've been through the rain.  But I'll be fine ...   Cause I've got faith of the heart.  I'm going where my heart will take me.  I've got faith to believe. I can do anything.  I've got strength of the soul. And no one's gonna bend or break me.  I can reach any star. I've got faith, faith of the heart.   Cause I've got faith of the heart.  I'm going where my heart will take me.  I've got faith to believe. I can do anything.  I've got strength of the soul. And no one's gonna bend or break me.  I can reach any star. I've got faith, faith of the heart. Once again, i sit on this chair in this stale room just wanting to write something yet i do not have any idea what i am going to write about. i think to myself, why am i awake and not treasuring whatever sleep i can get before i go to camp where i have to sleep on a bed which i appernetly "inherited" from the last man that slept on that very bed. This bed will stay with me as long as i am in this camp or at least i think so. Listening to the music that i am playing on my playlist pushes my mind to my beautiful place. A place that i had dreamt of quite awhile ago and i remember the sweet smell of fresh dew and the lush green grass and the sweet scent of the flowers. The singing children never seem to grow weary of their joyous songs running around a great big tree which has no shadow. The sun shines so bright in the sky, shining at every nook and cranning letting no shadow ever take form. Yet as bright as the sun is it does not hinder my eyes and blemishes my skin. The winds blow and i can hear the wind whisper to me and i seem to understand of what she speaks of. The leaves join in the childrens' song and the flowers dance in the wind but although she blows, it never gets cold. Everything seems so complicated and unnatural but a part in me does not bother and i slowly let down my guard as a little boy leads me by the hand and we run and run through the lands and past many rivers but we never grow tired. And at last we reach the sea and i look into the water which is so clear and the sand so soft and i sit. the dream ended ther but in my mind i would not forget. how can i possibly forget something so beautiful and then i think of the many things in my life thats beauty has been marred. i guess my dreams are my hope and aspirations. Something that is there to keep me standing and picking myself up as i fall. i want to share my dream with many but there are the critics. i want to share the dream yet i find it of too much significance and i only want to share it with one. But i guess these are the things that will unfold by itself and i should not bother too much about it which might cause to destroy everything i believe in once again.. As i sit in my dark-stale room, i cant help but think how time has passed by so fast and army is just one day away. i start to think of my friends and family and how things would change outside without my knowing therefore many thoughts run through my head and slowly i come to feel a mix of hope and paranoia. i cannot comprehend how i can make something so simple seem so wrong leaving no room for effort and chance, always botherind myself with the unconsequencial yet many things that are not might be tommorrow and i worry. Sometimes i pray for a ray of light that might shine upon the darkness that surrounds me but that is the one thing that i fear the most. Most of the time i prefer to hide in the shaodows, the shadows of others therefore leaving me unseen, unnoticed and many a time all alone. In this loneliness i find a resting place and comfort in my plight but then again this darkness consumes me and i come to find that i have walked round the mountain and back again making no possitive change and only making another entry for negetivity. Many things that many has told me and i remember but what i do not understand is how can these things be accomplished? Although at the back of my mind i know i have done what i could but i still want to push myself forward and far beyond the expectations that anyone can set for me. i have longed to be recognised as someone who is capable and not the failure that i am known to be. i come to realise that this longing, this hope are but dreams as i sleep and to ever achieve such "status" is like seeing jesus coming and lifting me up and he whispers these words into my ear,"we are going home." But then maybe one day, someday something good might come to be and i shall smile again once more. With thanks to Victoria Lim this blog was born and this shall be the first pathetic entry. well... that is about it.. im quite busy but maebe later i might find the time to do something more proper.   It has been awhile of pain, agony and horible nightmares and the light, the little glimpse of hope which i had always held on had shone its blessing on me and brought me someone to bring me through. It seems that i have found my comfort zone. My little place of rest or a time for me to think about the good times and be comforted for the tribulation that has befelled me. I have prayed for this, prayed till the skin on my knees and torn, bled and hardened. My fingers locked together numb and there is almost no more strenth for me to rejoice but there is still one more prayer. The prayer of thanks.   After booking in, i had spent the entire night listening to nice but depressing songs play on the vcd walkman that has been hooked up to the television that is in the bunk that i sleep in and that is probably the place that i will be sleeping in for the next two years.      As i listen to the music, i see flashbacks of my life. I see the times that i drank with friends and made merry and i see the times that i drank in a desperate attempt to drown all my thoughts. I sat there just thinking of how i would have been so pitiful if i wasnt so pathetic.    I did not want to do it but it was something that i had done a long time ago and as far as i remember i liked it. I picked up my knife and cut myself and as i watched the blood ooze out and as it flows out, i took out a cigarette to soak up the blood and i found that cigarettes look better red than white. I lit it and drew its first cloud of smoke that filled my lungs and as i exhaled, i tasted somehting in the cigarette. Push my fingers into my eyes... It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache... But it's made of all the things I am today... Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside...If the pain goes on... Aaaaaaaah!   I have screamed until my veins collapsed I've waited last, my time's elapsed Now, All I do is live with so much fate I've wished for this,  I've bitched at that I've left behind this little fact:You cannot kill what you did not create I've gotta say what I've gotta say And then I swear I'll go away But I can't promise you'll enjoy the lines I guess I'll save the best for last My future seems like on big past You'll live with me 'cause you left me no choice   I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the acheIf the pain goes on,I'm not gonna make it!   Pull me back together I'll seperate the skin from the bone Leave me all the Pieces, and then you can leave me alone Tell me the reality is better than dream But I found out the hard way, Nothing is what it seems!   I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the things I am today Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!   All I've got...all I've got is insane... All I've got...all I've got is insane... All I've got...all I've got is insane! All I've got...all I've got is insane!   I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the thing I am today Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!    I had a dream which nearly cost me very dearly. A beautiful dream which my mind had turned into a complete nightmare.   A beautiful dream of beauty, freedom, family and most of all love. i remember a white dress with only abit of colour keeping innocence and restoring happiness. Long orangy-brown hair, black piercing eyes and a smile that i for one cannot forget and smooth soft skin with a slight tann.   Suddenly her wounds hurt and start to open  her two feathered wings are torn and broken  her halo is but a needle hole  the flowers die as the cold winds blow  her two little legs lift off the ground  the tombs open and the bodies are bound  their bone white skulls scream all so loud  over their heads a little black cloud  Every Beginning Has An End  Thats Just The Way We Are Made.....We Are Men.   I got into a scuffle back at camp and there was so much shit going on and before i knew it i was in the medical centre waiting to go to the hospital. They thought that i was a basket case and well.. i was dropped out of course and now i join my Company HQ doing admin and some work in the store. I have come to learn alot of things and one of them is that there is one big problem in my life that is causing so many things that has gone wrong and the answer is me. It had been two weeks since i met her and i started to find it hard to convince myself that there was love in the relationship at all. There was a enormous blackhole eating me from the inside and everything seems to be unstable. It seems the good things that has been happeneing to me lately were but dreams and maybe false hope. Or maybe it was just not the right one. I have once again found myself making something perfect beyond perfect. This time there were modifications. I never demanded anything from her, i always raced to take out my wallet and i have paid for everything as long as i was with her with the exception of one time in a taxi where she smartly occupied me with carrying her stuff and therefore when the taxi stopped, she already had her money out. I did everything i could to shower her with the uttmost love and affection and gave her all the freedom that she wanted. I never wanted to consrict her or tie her down lest i lose her but now i have decided that i lose her. I felt very much that she never wanted to meet me and she was just with me to occupy her mind as at that point in time, she had someone on her mind but now she is strong and she has gotten over it. These are but mere assumptions on my part and i know it is wrong as i am not trusting her but i guess some things about me do not change. I always need that speacial someone to push me and guide me. The someone to hold my hand as the sun rises and kiss me as it sets. Someone to tend to my wounds should i hurt myself. Someone to breathe life into me when everything seems meaningless.  I guess the search continues and only with time more things will unfold and sort out. Well it has been quite awhile and this blog is starting to "grow cobwebs" as the pics and such are not updated. There has been no time for me to think of these things but i am sure i will get down to it.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 6th time. The tested sentence is:  When I first started using the World Wide Web I started on Netscape v. 2.0.  It seemed fantastic at the time, but I was even more impressed when Netscape v. 3.0 was released.  Finally after I met my wife and used her old x486sx with Windows 95 I first laid eyes on Internet Explorer v. 3.0.  I have used Internet Explorer from v. 3.0 to v. 6.0 and now once again I believe it is time for change.  While Internet Explorer is a fast, free, and  a reliable web browser, it has one HUGE HUGE HUGE problemâ€¦.. SECURITYâ€¦.  For the past several hours I have been using Mozillaâ€™s FireFox 0.9.1 and have visited sites that would have just demolished my computer if I viewed them with IE.  Also during this entire time I have not received a single popup.  Even with a popup blocker while using I.E, I still had a tremendously hard time completely avoiding popups. I must applaud Michael Moore for Fahrenheit 9/11.  I saw the movie on opening night in Tupelo Mississippi 6/25/2004 at the 7:35PM showing.  It was a powerful movie that dragged me through an entire range of emotions.  It would take through both laughter and extreme sadness.  For the first time ever I saw an audience applaud a movie.  It was a superior documentary and I believe everyone age 13 and up should see it. Today was a magnificent day.  For the past several weeks my wife has been on dialysis due to poor kidney function.  As of today her creatinine levels have returned to almost normal levels, she currently has 50% kidney function and does not need dialysis.  At this point I am ecstatic and I am hoping for a full recovery.   I feel bad for anyone who has to endure dialysis.  Imagine three times a week, having to go sit in a chair, unable to movie for five hours while every drop of blood in you is removed, filtered, and reinserted into your body.  That to meâ€¦would suckâ€¦â€¦! Today I weigh 255.5 pounds.  Thatâ€™s a far cry from what I started at (315 pounds) a little over a year ago.  My goal weight is 200 pounds; anything below that I believe will be too thin.  During the past year I have gone from a person who couldnâ€™t run 1/8th mile, to someone who could run at my highest 10 miles.  Currently I am able to run 2 miles, but my goal is 26.2 miles, so I have gone in reverse far as my training.  Losing weight is hard for me, but gaining it is easy.  I donâ€™t have a fast metabolism, but running helps make up for my cursed genetics.  My goal is to lose the 55.5 pounds extra by Christmas, but doing that will fairly be difficult.  Everyoneâ€™s body is different.  It is this fact that no diet will work for everyone.  I enjoy carbohydrates too much to punish myself by eating the Atkins diet.  My method of dieting is to rapidly try things and adapt to what works.  Sometimes it is successful, sometimes it is not, but the body seems to change so what works now, may not work in two or three weeks.  Damn. People need to protect themselves.  I donâ€™t understand how in todayâ€™s age people can have promiscuous sex and not use protection.  My wifeâ€™s best friend now has herpes.  Why?  Because she met someone online, they met offline, and he shot his load inside her.  He infected her with herpes.  When she confronted him through AOL Instant Messenger he just laughed about it.  Meanwhile she was forced to go from someone who was having sex with thirty different guys to having sex with none.  Some people say it doesnâ€™t feel natural to wear a condom.  My response always is, â€œSo does the burning itch of herpes feel natural?â€?  Other people say, â€œIt canâ€™t happen to me.â€? My response is usually, â€œBullshit!â€?  I am not opposed to having hot steamy casual sex with everyone you can get your hands on, but by refusing to use protection you are saying you donâ€™t give a fuck about yourself or your partner.  The worst kind of person is one who takes the risk, contracts the disease, and then spends the rest of their life bitching about it.  My wifeâ€™s friend does this constantly.  She wonâ€™t shut up about how sheâ€™s infected and how her life is ruined.  Take your chances if you want, but just remember, having an STD is not sexy, it doesnâ€™t feel natural, and it can happen to you.  Care enough about yourselves to use protection.  If you do contract the disease due to your own stupidity, donâ€™t bitch about it. For the past month or so I have heard a lot of buzz around the new mail system that Google has come out with in beta called GMail.  I anxiously awaited my invitation to join and finally it arrived.  The thing I notice first and I assume everyone does is the 1000 MBs of storage capacity.  This and the clean look is what sets Google apart from the rest of Web Based email.  In my opinion the most important thing about GMail is not the 1000 MBs of storage, but the clean look to it.  Opening GMail, Yahoo, and Hotmail side by side, GMail is the only one not plagued with tons of banner ads.   In the near future GMail will start with the Google Adwords, but AdWords in general are much less annoying than banners, popups, and popunders.  They allow me to focus more on the content than the ads, but at the same time AdWords are more relevant than the normal banner ad which means sometimes even I click on them to read their content.  In summary GMail is the Ferrari of web mail services.  Itâ€™s clean, fast, reliable, and good looking.  The only thing I see lacking is the inability to use POP3 email which is why GMail could never be my primary email service. I have never used a blog before.  I donâ€™t really read them often, but some people have some interesting ideas.  I really donâ€™t think I am a person with interesting ideas as much as they are unique.  I am starting this blog mainly to keep up with my day to day happenings as a memory tool kind of.  Just something so I donâ€™t forget my entire life.  I could care less if anyone ever reads this.  Truly my life is not all that entertaining so anybody who does read my blog will probably fall asleep.  Iâ€™ve often tried to keep Journals in the past.  They either get lost or destroyed.  Sometimes they would go months or yeas without being written in.  I am going to try to continue posting using the blog, but if I donâ€™t.  Iâ€™m sure it will just be another thing that will be lost in time. I thought I, Robot is a decent movie, but not a great movie.    It has a shameless product placement ad for Converse All Star Sneakers.    In the movie the shoes were â€œVintage 2004â€?.    If Will Smith had focused more on the task at hand and less on the damn footwear it would have been a much better movie.      <>  Even with the advertising, it was still a movie worth seeing.    I want a sequel, but I doubt one could be made where it is actually worth watching. For the past couple of weeks things have been pretty good.    My wife is on a well deserved vacation in   Savannah  , GA.    She has been though    a lot lately with renal failure, blood clots, and other horrible painful problems.    Hopefully she will come back today fully rejuvenated and ready for veterinary college this fall.    I am excited for her and I hope it isnâ€™t too hard on her.             My job is going great; I failed to do a migration of MS Exchange 2000 to its new hardware.    It was a domain controller which is where I believe the migration problems started.    The entire firmâ€™s email was down for four days, now luckily itâ€™s over with.    Now that the Exchange server is finally migrated I can begin working on other issues.             My diet is going well though I went high protein, medium fat, and low carb.    It wasnâ€™t due to hunger or anything but greed.    After reading about ketosis I decided to jump on the metabolic advantage bandwagon.    October the 6 th  I plan on going back to my high protein, medium carb and low fat diet.    While I am having no problems with being on this diet, it just doesnâ€™t feel right to eat this much fat even if weight loss does occur rapidly.    I only want to achieve and maintain 180-200 pounds.                 Maybe things will continue to go wellâ€¦ I am studying for a MCP certification exam now.    Itâ€™s taking a lot of time. Many people say it is not safe to lose more than one or two pounds a weekâ€¦  Many people say to start an exercise program gradually to avoid injuryâ€¦  I worry those people may be rightâ€¦  I have finally found a diet that really really works for meâ€¦  For the past year I have been slowly adjusting my diet and exercise trying new things, trying a variety of techniques.  Finally, 7/6/2004 I found a diet that works for me.  I am hitting it fast and furious because itâ€™s rare for me to be able to go through a day not starving constantlyâ€¦  For me this diet has been a miracle and I hope it stays that way.  I havenâ€™t taken any pills or supplements other than vitamins to stay healthy.  This diet focuses on eating low fat, high protein, and medium carbohydrate.  This diet counts every calorie and watches the values of fat, carbohydrates, and proteins.  The diet requires high motivation and the willingness to eat to live, not live to eat.    This is all new to me at the moment, I feel as if I have come across a miracle that works for me.  Itâ€™s too new to know if it will continue to work for me, but by October 6th I will know exactly how well it is working.  October 6th will be the next day I step on the scales.  It is a three month diet trial and I donâ€™t want to risk screwing it up by stepping on the scales and lowering motivation.  My current weight is 252, with this new diet I worry heavily about losing muscle mass quickly.  The diet only has between 1,300-1,700 calories depending on the day.  I am not hungry at all during this time, but I am exercising profusely because I have the energy to do so.  On this diet I have high energy, high self control, and I donâ€™t feel hungryâ€¦   I am paying close attention to my body.  If I feel weak I add more carbohydrates, if I feel hungry I add more proteins, and if my body hurts I will change exercises.  If I can remember, my next report on Weight will be October the 6th hopefully with a loss of 15-20 pounds of fat not muscle.  My long term weight goal is about 180-200lb of muscle not fat.  Once I lose the fat, I fully intend to continue dieting and exercising for life to maintain what I want to achieve. It was a great Holiday weekend 7-3 through 7-5/2004.  Saturday(7-3) my wife, Joey and I all went to Ballard Park to see fireworks.  Sunday I mowed both my brother-in-laws and my own yard.  Monday, my brother-in-law and I went to Tupelo to see his parents and get some cash so he can graduate.  On Saturday the parking in Ballard Park was a nightmare.  People were inconsiderate at their parking blocking everyone in, in every direction.  It has been raining this summer more than any other since I have moved to Mississippi.  The ground was soaked so before we came to Ballard Park we got a tarp that went below our sheet that we sat on the ground.    So there, my wife, Joey and I all sat; looking around at the sites, watching the sky, and eating PB&J, Pimento and Cheese, and brownies.  Eventually the fireworks went off, and â€¦ we were behind a god damn tree.  So quickly we all get up, Joey grabs one end of the tarp, I grab another and we yank it under a bright street lamp.  For the next 20 minutes we sat, tried to watch the fireworks, and had 30-60 bugs crawling on us at any one time.  The bugs ranging from crickets to mosquitoes were some of the most annoying things I have ever seen.   After the show, we packed up our blanket, tarp, and coolers and started towards the car.  Traffic was a nightmare.  People had serious road rage, trying to cut everyone off.  Of course I joined in and was more successful than 90% of the people out there at winning the cut off.  I am normally a calm laid back person, but if their going to be rude, then so am I.  Sunday, I spent the entire day mowing.  The grass was still damp and the mower died often, but in general it was a successful day.  The yard work got done, my wife spent the day resting from Saturday, and I really felt like I had accomplished something.  It was a fantastic day.  Monday, I went to Tupelo with my brother-in-law.  We had a Coffee at Books-A-Million, saw Spider Man 2(good movie), and ate supper at Harveyâ€™s.  Everything went as planned and everyone had a decent time.  My brother-in-law lost his cell phone; we searched everyone under the sun, but in the endâ€¦. We never found it.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 7th time. The tested sentence is:  And if you told me to jump off a cliff, I'd say okay. Ive done it now, and now I'm not biased to it now. well, I'm in Knoxville now and its great, we got here the day before yesterday, and its been great, we walked around town night before last and then we went to this uber cool bookstore last night, tonight I dont know what we're doing, but I strongly believe that Adam can increase the "fun factor" of the night, he's been able to each night. well, Ive got to go now, Ill be posting more often now.  talk to you later        AND again I say no! Jack Black as My FAVORITE SUPERHERO!? (The green Lantern, which the movie is still in development is to put Jack Black on as The Green Lanturn.) no no no. Dont get me wrong but this is what has been said about the film:                  "The gossip site(  urlLink aint it cool news ) says that the film adaptation (of The Green Lantern) is being described as a "crazy and zany film" and will be in the realm of Jim Carrey's "The Mask." The site also says that DC Comics is objecting to this approach but that Warner Bros. has the final say. "       This just dissapoints me, The Green LAnturn has always been my fave superhero, and Now Warner Bros. is going to degreade his persona, oh how the mighty have been tripped and have fallen... Well, I just thought I put some emphasis on the fact that I am a Catalyst thinker. But what Is a Catalyst thinker? It is somone whom Adam thinks is worthy to be linked to on his site, well, I am linked, so thats that. you can get to Adams Site  urlLink here urlLink   Well I'm here at the church office and I' am listening to this really fricken awesome band called Falling Up. they're cool, you should listen to them, yeah. well Adam says we're fixin to go, I wrote some songs finally, and I'm ready to go now to where'er we go, which I belive at the moment the location of interest is Amandas house. http://www.fallingupcrashings.com/ Well guys sorry I havent posted in a while... Ive had a Busy week. Well, I went to an appointment with my mom yesterday, it was okay, but todays wasn't, I wish I could have been there. I went to Charlies house last night, it was AWESOME!! we had about, 5 guitars goin at the same time, it was great, all there, praisin God, yea, but I forgot my guitar, so halfway thru I went and talked to Amanda, and then that was about the basis of my night. Went to the mall today, got some "Love Spell" put on me and saw some girl pick her wedige, that was repulsive, what  HAS  the world come to, when girls have the fortitude to pull up their skirts and pick wedgies? I dont know. Well, I'll post more later, mom needs the computer. if you only knew... if you only knew... well today was an interesting day, I just got through with some "business" that I had to attend to, which I wont elucidate in here, for there are prying eyes about... well, spent the night at Adams house, and then went to Matts house adn then went home, well, Im glad Im home ( for some odd reason) , Im tired, I have HAMS and I wanna make some music, but Im frusterated so Ill  soon make music b4 I sleep and then Probably watch a movie, and then probably talk on the net, and probably, go to sleep then... we'll se how that turns out wont we!? otay then i dont know what to write anymore Okay then, whats all this? I'm gonna go play my guitar for the rest of the night tonight, and eventually fall asleep as I normally do when I need to think deeply. maybe I really need to breathe deeply, take a break, but I cant. Umm, the word "umm" just epitomizes that which I am feeling right now... I'll explain in the morning im too tired and blank minded to know right now...ive got church in the morning. well, i woke up this morning to my father "Wake up and come help me clean the yard, I'm gonna mow the yard." so I moaned,and got up to help thinking, okay, I'll be up for about twenty mins, and then I can go back to bed, ill thought on my behalf I guess... Im awake now and I have nothing to do, and im still tired, but I can't get back to sleep, im up now, what do ya want!? okay, well, i wanna do something today, so when mom gets back from Home depot, (shes been there for about 2 hours now, I wonder what shes doing!?) I'll see if we can go to the mall, and Amanda was saying she was gonna be bored today, so I'll see if she wants to come, better check her journal, and see if shes been online yet... and then I'll have to get off-line to call her... I'll post more later! g'day mates! okay it hasn't been a while since my last post, but I was thinkin, I miss being called Moose, I really do... I miss it... okay, took a shower tryin to go to bed.... dont you just hate the feeling that your screaming, but you dont know what you're screaming about?... i dont kno... WHY DONT WE FREAKEN MOVE TO LAKELAND!? sorry about that recent outburst, just a little thing. umm, well, I wish we would move, I've got the best friends ever here, (no offence to the Fort Meadeans who accept me, though  you are so few in number) and people accept me. and I'd just really like it. either move or the stupid state law changes and lets me drive alone now... that'd be great, I'm not a bad driver.... maybe i Should do that now anyways, break the law, its not like i havent done it in the past. but o well... well i had much much more to write, but i gotta write an email now too, so Ill talk to all the few people that read this blog later, Goodnight well i dont know of much interesting that has happened lately, i got some Tart N' Tinys, which is like bliss in a tiny, tart, tart n tiny, and i wish i was listening to some Nirvana right now, and ... and ... and... umm crap i lost my train of thought, i really wish i had a caboose, i wonder what others think about that...  Orazael: i need a caboose XoGRITSxo: hey, i'm sorry, lol, but i was just leaving   Orazael: i need a caboose RKrox3: huh?  Orazael: i need a caboose AaRainbow05: lol   Orazael: i need a caboose gato89kc: a caboose?? gato89kc: why? gato89kc: lol  well there it is, what happens when you tell ppl you need a caboose, by the way, my SN on AIM is Orazael thats all for now i guess.... what has the world come to, its 12:36 AM right now and i was rootin about in an AIM chattroom being boring and found a 6th grade girl(wasnt lookin for one, but i found one), just talkin away to me (odd i thought, and still do, its past her bed-time im sure), i looked on her "live journal" and found that one of her posts was full of explaitive after explaitve sent to some strange poor sap named "Tyler" i wasnt as much a potty mouth as her when i was in 6th grade,sure i said a few bad words here and there, but i could taste the soap when i was done. im flabberghasted. wow. well, i guess thats it for my first post! you could say its a grand opening of sorts... o well Charley has now passed over my house, and left some damage, see the second picture (it  was  our barn), but other than that, no human injuries. and, well Im still hoping to et to lakeland somehow tomorrow, I sure hope they have more power than I do, we have none, but the phone lines still work, so I can sue the laptop battery, as I am doing now. well id better scoot, battery will die soon, and im about to go into sleep mode.- Goodnight I hope all my fellow Floridians are well... And that is my favorite picture of him. I got to get picked up and go to his house tonight, before whence setting out unto the Wed. night service for fun. I got covered in shaving cream, popcorn and corn chips placed on me, and then I couldn't see, but Mandy, whom I met tonight gave me the gift of sight by wiping off one side of my "goggles" thus I was able to see. we sang then and, and heard Adam speak, which was another highlight, and then Marlon took me home. We will sit upon getting gason the way home for a moment. We were at the "PIX" Gas Station. there is a girl there that I met when we were having the "Scavenger Hunt" one Wed. night and I met her with Jonathan. Jon knew her, and we needed an Attendant to wipe our windshield for one of the "hits" that we had to film, she was that attendant. but It was funny tonight being that she obviously didnt remember who I was, but knew that I looked familiar and I was watching her try to figure out where she had seen me before. It was actually quite intriguing. but again, i must say, before i go to bed. Marlon Wareley is my FAVORITE South African. My first days of have been cool I guess, I have a good schedule, and Im sure I can get straight A's and have a good year this year, I have no last period class so I get outta school at 12:45 practically every day, which includes my lunch. which is cool, and I can graduate with 25 credits too. but you know whats funny, its already been two days, and Ive already found a girl on my radar that I admire, I hate that, I dont want to like people just yet I'm too quixotic, and it'll only be a matter of time before she hurts me ha ha. oh well, I'll control myself. Off of that subject now thanks, Ive got some cool teachers, and a  few  cool friends, I'm trying to stray away from the crowd that I was in last year, yet they are the only place I fit in, I trust God to help me. Which I am cool with doing. And it shouldnt be hard to do. on the 23rd I start college, and second semester I am a Seinor, wich I am technically now, but literally I wont be until next semeseter. So thats that. Goin to Adam's tomorrow. should be good, Ill post again from there. Goodnight. Or at least the muffin man, I had to bake muffins last night for this teacher breakfast thingy at school, and I'm not gonna go on a rant about "School" because it scares me, even the thoughts of such. So I baked muffins last night, talked to Jon on the phone, and then recorded some "musaac" until my eyelids obscured my vision. Ergo I was then Asleep. Thus, I woke up this morning fatigued and quite in need of a good espresso, alas I did not have this and I am now running on empty at this point and time.  But I will wrok thru it. Ill post more in a few mins when I can find something interesting to post about! Well I couldnt think of much to post on tonight and I knew that I needed to stay consistent in my posts. so I know that which I am going to post about tonight. Saturday night was the greatest. We had our first "youth whom are going into the ministry" small group meeting thing. it was bliss for me, I really needed something like that. We got to learn alot that night and share alot too (yes I did still mange to stick my fott in my mouth as always a few times). Today, was a fairly decent day, Matt kept me up til 3 the morning before church by playing music. as he always does before going off to bed, the only thing was was that I had my guitar out, so I'd hear a song and be like "I love that song, Ihave to learn it" so I would, so now I know 311 "Love Song" which is an awesome song to say the very least and I also know "Float On" by Modest Mouse. I learned more, but alas I am tired tongiht and I have since forgotten the songs, and Matt took the CD that I learned the songs from home. oh well! okaeday then. well we get to church and church stressed me out. i need to get ore sleep before church later on, i know this now. but it was awesome! there were quite a few people from Anna Maria Island down and it was great getting to see all them again, I even got to know that Ben and I are alot alike. Then, we went to a cookout thingy and it was goooood, I got to meet some new people, in particular, Kendra (i do hope that is the correct spelling) a friend of Amandas, she was quite cool. After the cookout thingy Adam, Matt, Lora and I returned to Adams house. Then, everyone but me went out to eat. and I did some latin and got to eventually talk to my BEST FRIEND Amanda which I enjoyed muchly. But just for a moment, let me deviate off to some "ranting" about my friend. I love my best friend (in a totally "friend manifesto" not a "more than friend manifesto") and she is in my opinion one of my my favorite people. we had a few moments today, but the most intriguing was when something was said about "a mission trip to go fishing" and she and I both, at the same time said "we would be fishers of.......fish!!" which was quite interesting. we have the whole "mental connection thing" goin on and we tend to sya the same things at thte same time, or finish each others sentences, which is cool. I would have a Best Friend no other way. In the great words of Lassie "WOOF! WOOF!"
+++++ THE GENDER: FEMALE equals to: MALE
ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 8th time. The tested sentence is:  I like stuff.  I wish I had money to buy lots of stuff.  But I dont.  Is stuff what makes people happy?  In my eyes if I had lots of stuff I think that i'd be happy, but people say that nice things or money isnt the key to happyness.  I dont know.  I mean I know I shouldnt keep buying name brand stuff, but if I dont then I feel like Im a outsider.  Tell me what you people think ok?? Well last night was T's party.  It was a good time, I think.  I remember swiming and fireworks.  I also remember sleeping in cabe's car.  I'm sleepy so I will blog more later. Im out..............Im so sleepy.  Goodnight friends of Dlog's Blog. I remember one time my friends and I took a ride to the Yale campus.  It was a trip in a half.  We met up with a friend I knew who goes to Yale.  That night I will never forget.  First off because she was the cutest little thing you ever hope to meet but second because it was the first "road trip" the group had ever taking.  Pete, J Juice, Alex, Cabe, and T Bomb.  T and Cabe were in another car and J, Alex and I were in one.  T was driving so we all were a little afraid of how that was going to turn out.   Anyways we were all fine intill we got into the city.  Yale chicks were walking around campus and Pete was looking for a taste.  I on the other hand was very nerves about meeting this "earth angel".  I kept looking back to see if Cabe and T were staying with us.  We got near the school and looked around for parking, nothing, not one spot was open, hey it was friday night and it was New Haven.  So Alex and I got out of the car and Juice looked around for a spot with T behind him.  I remember Al saying to me Tim (T Bomb, Tank, T bag, Tammy....etc.) is going to get lost, I thought so as well.  Alex and I walked over under the street sign (Chapel) and waited for the rest of the guys.  Meanwhile I gave Cindy (the girl I talked about) a call.  She was coming down in 10 mins she said.  It was damn cold.  I remember a man asked me if I can give him bus fear and a cig he said he had lost his wallet and he needed to get home, mostlikely he was lieing but i did it anyways.  Alittle after the bum walked away Alex and I saw Tank drive past us, we called for him but he didnt look.  "Shit there he goes, hes getting lost."  I remember Alex saying.  He did.  Joe and Pete came around the corner a couple of secs after T pasted.  Joe ended up paying 5 bucks to park in a lot and was upset.  Then Cindy Coco came across the street.  My chest began to feel warm in the winter cold.  I dont remember what we said at first but I remember a hug being made between us.  T never showed up.  The group had a bunch of theory's at what might have happened.  Funny ones at that.  You have to know Tank to understand why it is funny.  T of all people to get lost in the city. LOL.  Well we all went for pizza and then Cindy and I went to see her frineds a local ice cream shoppe they were hippies lol they were cool tho.  After that we went to her dorm.  A big frat party was going on and it looked sweet.  But I wanted to chill with Cindy.  We got up to her dorm and her temp roommate was there.  She was kinda cute I really cant remember.  But we chilled and played so gitty (guitar) and it was fun.  Then we went for some coffee at Star Bucks.  Joe wanted to go so he went to get the car while Coco and I stayed in Star Bucks.  A Bum was bugging some people at the table next to him but I gave him a smoke and he went away.  I dont no why I help bums.  Maybe because Im afraid of them.  Anyways Joe came and I had to say goodbye to the cutest.  We hugged and I got into the car.  We got lost on the way home and we didnt get back till one.  It was 11 when we left.  We yelled at each other and I screamed then got out of the car and puked.  I wasnt drinking I was just sick from the goddamn pizza, it sucked.  We got home.  The next day we called T.  He was mad.  So it goes. So this is High School bullshit??  If I remember you called me at FIVE IN THE FUCKING A.M.!!  I was happy sleeping, dreaming of whatever I was dreaming about.  I told you we can hang later but no you had to call me back till I said come on over.  So it looks to me that somebody wanted something.  And if you say you wanted to hangout thats bull it was 5 A.M. mind you!!  I dont wanna talk about it I still like you and Dlog's Blog is a happy place so no yelling. Whats up bloggsters?  Im just hangin' round downtown by myself and I had to much time to sit and thing about myself.  LOL So not much to report...I just ate din din, Im at my Aunt's house.  She lives in a 2 million dollar house.  When Im here I feel rich.  Someday I will have mad coin but not right now. What a day!  I dug holes all day and moved 80 lb bags of concrete.  Fun, fun, fun.  I got there with five bucks and left with 237.  I should have a hell of a lot more but Im only getting 8 bucks a hour, which I might add blows balls. WHAT THE HELL IS WITH EVERYBODY"S SODDEN OBSESSION WITH EMO??  Its pretty corny, if you are sad you are sad, you don't need to make a style out of it!  Making a style out of being sad just shows how materialistic we people of the great United States are. Im up, Im up.  Its 6 in the morning and I wanna go back to bed.  But I got to go the workplace, WHICH SUCKS. Im sleeping.  The AC was on in my room all day, so its like a icey relax pit........I cant wait....See you when the sun comes up over the hill. Hello.  Its late and I have to go to work at 7:00.  That sucks, but I have a new computer in mind so I got to work hard for the money. Hmmmmm........ It's Summer!  Schools out.  Im afraid to go back there, most of my friends have graduated and I am all alone.....Well maybe that means I'll do good instead of partying all year.......JohnQ is going to NVCC so that means Ill still hang with him.  Thats a plus!  Keep it real JQ! My 1st post of Dlog's Blog.  I hope you enjoy as my life is layed out for you. I got a new Apple ibook.  Its pretty sexy.  I can record my music for real, like a rockstar! LOL.  Im still working getting the grip of having a good computer thats mine. Hey Blogglovers.......Guess what?  I fell for another girl.  I always fall, Its dumb, I met this one girl and for like a week or two Im in love.  I don't know what the story is.  Well this weeks tasty pick is a girl from the far land of Colombia.  Shes in town for a couple of weeks.  You have to see her, she has the cutest little actsent.

The day goes by kinda fast tho, not really.  Im sick og building goddamn decks.  But I need the coins so I work.  Im going to New York this weekend with my dad and my cuz is taking a hot girl, one of her friends.  To bad I got the old ball and chain (Just kiding babe). She is tall, tan, long legs, nice rack, not to big not to small, soft, and smells fucking tasty.  I knew from the minute I saw her that I was going to get a lap dance from her.  I paid the man at the register and I entered a small room with about five chairs and nothing but black lights on.  I sat down in a chair against the far wall and looked up at the goddess before me.    â€œHey, how are you?â€? said in a cute sexy voice.    â€œIâ€™mâ€¦.Iâ€™m good.â€? I said baffled by her beauty.  â€œCan I take your hat off?â€?  â€œUmmâ€¦.I got a really bad haircut.â€? I blushed as I replied but the black lighting hid it.    â€œThatâ€™s okay sweetie, Iâ€™ll just turn it around.â€?   She proceeded to turn around my hat than turned around lowering her thong.  My eyes lit up as her ass slowly started to cheep closer and closer to my lap.  She sat down and started to move back a fourth, and believe you me that it was the best thing I have done in a while.  I was looking up at her in amazement, and then she turned around and put her chest in my face.  There I was sitting in a leather chair with my nose between to soft tits.  I was in fucking heaven.  As she did this she was rubbing my lap with her hands, I began to melt.  She smelled so fucking good, I never smelled such a wonderful smell in my life, and I could have stayed there forever and ever.  Time pasted and she finished up, she leaned up to give me a kiss on the cheek and she softly whispered, â€œthank you, my name is Meia.â€?   I was in love with a striper named Meia.  Thatâ€™s fucking retarded. come crash into me, im game.  The song goes, "she will be loved."  To bad its not by me but some fat-headed army man, maybe if i shot women and children in Iraq she would like me.                                                  -Douglas J.  Boucher III The Hotplates have died.  It's a sad Juice and Cerbs are going away to school so I'm stuck without a band.  But my friend is starting to play bass and it looks like I might have a new band. Hello.  Did you know Rick James died yesterday?  They say it was natural, lol I don't know about that.  I can quote Rick saying, "Cocaine is a hell of a drug."  Well I guess Dave Chappelle is out of a job, wait he still has R. Kelly.  T Bomb went to the Rush show tonight, he says it was, "a hell of a rush."  I myself am not a 'rush-head' but some stuff is okay.  People say that the Rush drummer is the best drummer in the world, HEY PEOPLE EVER HEAR OF KETH MOON?  T went with a girl from his work, good times.  Well tonight was okay for me, I went to Chili's with my cuz and her cuz.  Then we watched The Exorcist.  It's a okay movie but not a fav of mine.  School is coming up fast, my head is spinning.                             -Dougie B from way above the knee My name is Conway Peterson and I live in the upstairs room of, Goodies Spirits.  I guess itâ€™s not all that bad I get the out of code beer for free, but itâ€™s a small place.  I attend school at the college across the street, SSVC, Smith Sampson Valley College.  Iâ€™m very popular on campus because of all the free beer; all the parties are late at night so nobody can see the out of code date.  The chicks at SSVC are okay but you should see some of the prep school chicks that sneak out of the rich school down the road.  Mill Valley is a dry campus and parties are frowned upon, so horny schoolgirls with a pocketbook full of Daddyâ€™s credit cards stop by. My friend is going to the Rush show at the meadows, he is taking a hot girl.  WIll they have a good time?  I have a feeling that there is going to be alot of drugs at this Rush show.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 9th time. The tested sentence is:  i should be sleeping right now... it's 3.30 am... urlLink my so-called life... What i learned from Max Bickford....  	i was watching 'The Educaton Of Max Bickford' a few minutes ago... and by that, i meant it ended a few minutes ago, not that it started a few minutes ago, in case some of you do not belong in the DNRC (in-duh-viduals) ... it was the September 11 episode... gotme thinking about some stuff... it's my blog, so i'ma write it down...  	firstly, i have a question. lets say you work in an orchard... your 'boys' have picked all the apples and arranged 'em in big, huge wicker baskets... you randomly pick one apple, bite into it, and find a fatass worm in it... but you eat it anyway... but that's not the point...   my question is, would you throw you the whole basket of apples (it's big, so there are probably 100-200 apples in it) just because one apple was bad? well, unless you're an idiot, you won't, right?   so why do people discriminate against one whole race just because of one bad apple?  	take, for example, Osama, or whomever masterminded the Sept.11 thing. i mean like, out of like, 11 MILLION arabs, a few jackasses wanted a free ticket to hell. so, why were anyone who were arabs discriminated? i mean like, according to what i heard in CNN or read in the news, anyone who were arabs, or at least LOOKED like arabs, were put down as potential terrorists. SOME people see an arabic looking guy walking down the street, they shun him and call the cops who go over and ask for his ID, with the safety pins on their Sig Sauers off. i mean, who cares if it was his GRANDPA who came from  the middle east, and he probably knows every word in the Constitution and/or the National Anthem  (which is more than i could say about most citizens in any country), but still, hey, he has dark skin, has a goatee (coz his gurlfriend told him it looks cute), he must have a bomb in his pocket and probably knows Osama. i mean, come on! can anyone stand up and tell me that's not bullshit?  	look, i respect the need for security. being lax in a time like this is stupid. that's like going to the projects wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood (remember Scary Movie 3 :D) . but (i think) there should be a limit to this... i mean, isn't america all about freedom? where's the dude's freedom in the above situation? i admit, i have never been in your situation, where your country is at war, and national security is threatened (damn, i'm lucky i'm in Malaysia... most peaceful place to be!!!)... PERHAPS i would be paraniod if i was in that situation. maybe not. hopefully not. but i plan to continue my education next year at Purdue University, Indiana. but that's not the point.  	what i'm trying to say is... perhaps we all should give people a chance... i mean, i am totally against labelling a whole race or summin just because of some idiots... because i know how it feels... as some of you might (or might not) know, malaysia is a multiracial country. the three major races here are the Malays (those who's ancestorial roots are in this country), the Malaysian Chinese (malaysian, but have ancestorial roots in China), and the Malaysian Indians (malaysian with ancestorial roots from India - my great-grandma moved from a village in South India and came here). Malaysia is more of a cultural mosaic, not a melting pot.  	in my school, a majority of Malaysian Indian boys don't really come from a privileged background. some of them have serious disciplinary problems at school. gangs, smoking, stuff like that. but, because of that, most people and teachers who see me, a big-bodied, tough-looking dark-skinned dude, they ASSUME i'm a gangsta-type dude too. But, the harsh reality is, i'm NOT! i'm a very gentle guy, polite, very well-mannered, and don't forget smart (no.3 in the whole school). but, newbie teachers, or those who don't know me, they see me, and they assume i'm a dangerous guy to be around with. of course, those who got to know me have a lot of respect for me (hehe... :D:D:D)   	what i'm trying to say is, don't judge a book by it's cover.  	anti-semitism is another example, but i really don't want to get into that now.  	i mean, what do you think about this? i hope reading this has somehow sparked off some neurons in your brains... i'm a very non-judgemental guy... i don't think that anyone is inherentmy bad, or good... your enviroment shapes the way you turn out... i mean, some terrorists... they are who they are because the enviroment shaped them... the people, the physical enviroment... i'm a peace loving guy... but with people with a set mindset who do terrorist actions, and wor-mongering presidents like Dubya around... it's just like a cycle... somehow it got started... then america under GBsenior went to war with iraq... then on September 11, some idiots retaliated... then another war-mongering idiot goes to war with THE WHOLE BLOODY COUNTRY over something some people did... then he moves to ANOTHER country... attacking it in a made-up accusation (where are those nukes, goddammit? :P)... sooner or later, someone's gonna strike back... and there it goes again... until we have someone smart enough to put a stop to this... yeah, after my death, most likely...  	i'm sorry if i offended anyone... that wasn't my intention... and like i said, i don't believe, like , all americans or all arabs are so-and-so just because of a few individuals... i'm an individualist... every person is unique... i just hoped i made you think about this...  -MistaMugie- Stolen from someone's Blog   www.mistamugie.blogspot.com  1) Starting time: 12.15AM 2) Full Name: Mugilan Joorindanjn 3) Nicknames: Mugie, MistaMugie, The Great Sex God, The Great God-Like Dude, Mugi-Mugi, Abang Mugie, and....

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 10th time. The tested sentence is:  As strangely beautiful the storm is ... it has it's way of affecting moods negatively. It's been raining non-stop for four days now. It seems that I haven't slept in as long.   I plan all day ... creating to do lists and checking over them to make sure i've missed nothing. Though when i'm home at last my mind begins to wander and I make up new projects as I go ... after cleaning the damn house of course. I did finally dig into a project for a friends Web Developing business. I'm mixing the music and sound effects for his clients page.   Just because i'm such a nice guy, I let the cats in out of the rain. In thanks they procees to take over the house ... two on the couch and one who loves my computer chair. Everywhere I go I have to shoe cats away. Good thing I like them. ;)  A friend gave me an article a few weeks ago. It talks about how writers are the worlds best procrastinators ... finding any excuse not to write. Nah ... not me! I love to write. hummm ... I successfully put off writing anything today and I actually had this full day off. Where is that article on writer's block? I'm going to need that. ;) Boomerang Thoughts (noun) Thoughts that get lost somewhere in the great void suddenly and then slowly return.  An exercise in free writing ... Just put your hands on the keyboard and let them fly. Spelling, Grammar, who gives a shiznit? It's too bad you can't loose weight with this exercise. The more thoughts you dump onto the paper the more poundage you lose. ;)Not that I'm overweight .. But this root beer gut has to go!  Perception Chronicles? ... Can you say "they suck!?" ... My self promotion needs some improving too I see. I'm my own worst critic. Although, if I expect anyone to "want" to read my stuff, it has to be better. I'll probably constantly rewrite the articles I've already posted. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to my writing. (Not my free writing obviously!)    So ... Um ... Why do I need to communicate these Chronicles? Why do humans need to communicate?  physical Issues - To be happy, physically, emotionally? Social Issues - To be included, part of a circle of friends and share ideas? Practical Issues - To hopefully influence someone with our ideas? Identity - ah! That's a huge one! Who am I? ... I have no clue ... It's a matter of perception. (Everything is a matter of perception!) How do I see the world? How do I want to see the world? How does the world see me? An ol' cadger who writes depressing Chronicles. ;) Well ... I do have a sense of humor. I just forget where it is sometimes. Alzhiemers ya know. Can't even spell that word.  Over all my Chronicles seem to fulfill all those requirements ... My readers require it to be worth reading ... That may need a little tweaking.   Forthcoming will be ... (Ivy League words are cool!) will be an article on an idea I'm kicking around about shared reality. Everyone has one base reality that we all share ... Then we build our own reality on top of that. Interesting concept. I have only a few ideas of where to go with that one. And the garbage can is full so ... Process of elimination is cool too!

Usually someone of the opposite sex.   They reach up and rub their nose, then you get all self conscious and you think "I have a cliff hanger ... Shit!" so as inconspicuously as possible you reach up and rub your nose. Now, they see this and they get self conscious and they, as inconspicuously as possible, rub their nose again.   *heavy sigh* it's a never ending circle that doesn't end until you both part company.   What is it about human nature that makes you go ... Hmmmmm Sometimes it helps to think of happy scenes; maybe a pastoral field, or a field with a babbling brook.

The rain has finally stopped. My sleeping habits haven't changed at all. Drifting off about 4 a.m. just to be smashing the snooze button at 6. You'd think the 12 hour days would be making me exhausted. Apparently it's only affecting my creative brain. My body just isn't tired, not even fatigue, though I can't concentrate long enough to get a logical thought on paper. This entry is obviously no exception.   I appreciate the comment Fhayzzzzer (everytime I do that, I can't get that guy and his voice out of my head. The one on the goofy movie who does the leaning tower of cheeeesssa with the cheese whiz.) and yeah ... my list is nearing two legal pads of things to do. Three more things added to day and nothing crossed off. There's that shared reality thing huh?   I seem to have missed the drama unfold on Terra's Playground. She's removed those postings. (insert some of Wilson's wise old comments here .. (home improvement)) Well, She seems like a tough nut ... She doesn't need to take anyone else's BS.   Anyway ...  "They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night."   Edgar Allen Poe  1:00 a.m. Way past time that I go give night time dreaming another try. ;) I've been slacking it appears.    It's strange how life works. You seem to get the things you don't really want; but the things you really want ... you can forget about ever having.    I really want a home; a family; but that's all been done and may not come my way again. I really want stability; taking a leap of faith isn't very stable   This could turn into a perception chronicle.    I've been offered the Direct TV job in Boise ... (that's four hours away from here) and i've been accepted to BSU and financial aid is willing to pay for me to attend.  Sounds like a good opportunity. Why am I so god damn scared.

II.  the street preacher says my parents probably engaged in hundreds of  conjugal acts.   i miss my parents, so i sit down on a patch of grass to hear more about them.  he says the curse of sin fell upon all mankind from the very beginning.  he says if i have not been born again he can only say one thing, that  i am going to hell.  he says "you say God is so merciful, he wouldn't put anyone in hell?  oh no?!   you're going to find out."   i continue on my way, doomed and small.  III.  "you know, the sympathy ones are hard to find," announces the greeting-card seller loudly to a frazzled customer who has been digging through the bins for twenty minutes, sweating in direct sunlight. I.  jet-lagged, i meet M at orchestra hall.  the orchestra plays gershwin.  the music reminds me of ballroom scenes in old hollywood movies, the ones where a man and a woman are dancing.  she's wearing a dress so beautiful all the housewives in america know they'll never have one like it, and all the working men know they'll never have a woman like her.  II.  we leave at intermission and go to the kissing room.  III.  i sleep next to J.  his cello rests in its shuck.  nearby, a closet is piled to the waist with classical music scores.  somewhere among them must be a piece written by a tired composer after a night just like this.

"this has been the worst day," she says to the person next to her.  "when i get to the pub i'm going to order a mix drink.  with liquor as the liquor and liquor as the mixer."  II.  don't like understanding every word people say.  jarring.  reach for estonian words every time i talk.  then realize i can leave those on the shelf.  english will do.  it's the only thing that will do.  III.  the hostage's head is made of lead and slate.  it has no human features and reaches upwards, doesn't get far.  it looks as though fingers with no fingernails were raked down one side.  nothing to say, no mouth to say it with.  it tried to form itself into a weapon, a sharp arrowhead, before it froze.  it was soft and beautiful once.  ("Head of a Hostage" is a sculpture by Jean Fautrier, on display at the Tate Modern art museum)  IV.  "i don't want botox," says the man in the deep blue pull-over. "you definitely need it," says the woman with the brown cap pulled down tight. "yeah, you need it," says the woman in the smokey pink cashmere sweater.  V.  "I don't like this," says the woman, and she walks quickly past  Head of a Hostage.    She moves eagerly toward a pretty golden bust of St. Peter  without bothering to read the title of the Fautrier sculpture,  or the curator's note: "At night [Fautrier] could hear  the Gestapo torture and execute prisoners in the nearby woods."   I don't like this ,  he must've thought to himself.  Unfortunately  St. Peter was nowhere in sight at the time.*   *When Jesus was betrayed, Peter drew his sword to defend him, but denied him later in the same night, as Jesus had predicted he would (John 13; Mat. 26.26-46, 57-75). "kas saad votta minu jaapani tantsu hiir?  ma ei saa votta tema kaasa ameerikasse...."  (can you take my japanese dancing mouse?  i can't bring her along to the states....)  "jah."  (yes.)  "vÃ¤ga hea!  tema nimi on betti.  ma annan sulle hiiri tÃµidu raha.  vÃµib-olla ta rÃ¤Ã¤gib jaapani keelt sinuga...ta ei kunagi rÃ¤Ã¤gi midagi mulle.  ta ka mitte tantsi."  (great!  her name is betti.  i'll give you money for mouse food.  maybe she'll speak japanese with you...she never says anything to me.  she doesn't dance either.)  we walked together through the town hall square before i went to the airport.  it was full of merchants selling bowls made of black alder and juniper, ceramic mugs, iron hooks, and birds made of grass.  he carried betti, her cage wrapped in a pillowcase.

"eunuch!  why don't i care about faraway kingdoms today?"  "sire, no man, no matter how great, can be concerned about distant matters day after day!" replied the eunuch.  the king sent the wise eunuch away and picked at his cape.  he picked at his crown.  he banged his scepter against a curtain and moaned.  "my carriage!" he wailed.  "eunuch! come!"  the entourage gathered in a flurry of bright cloth and horse skin.  the whole mess rattled loudly out of the castle, through the town, and into the country.  "what are these sloppy treed islands in the middle of my fields?" the king asked.  "my king," replied the eunuch, "these date from the birth of the field, when the farmers removed the rocks from the soil.  they piled them in a heap, then plowed around them year after year.  and so flowers, grass, and trees grew around and over them.  look there: storks nesting at the top of that Paradise Tree!"  the king thought of his royal potatoes, his royal beets and juicy mutton.  "what do these birds eat, eunuch?"   "eels, sire!"  the king ordered the carriage return to the castle at once.  each day thereafter he cried out to the eunuch, "any word from france?  any word from brazil?" and smiled, to be a man who could ask such questions and eat well every night.   * the king and his chief eunuch are based on the characters of the Shah-in-Shah and Patominos created by Joseph Roth in his novel _The Tale of the 1002nd Night_, translated into english by Michael Hofmann (Picador USA 1998). Odysseus murdered the loose servant girls-- we weren't told that he took their bodies one by one down to the sea and stripped them, ran one hand over each breast and one  between the legs before releasing them into the foam wake.  It is something any tyrant or hero would have done outside the pages of literature. No law forbids a man to feed his stomach, or to starve, waste, and hate his soul.  The figures of men darken the shore-line; they caress whatever is beautiful in those who bleed at their feet.  They wait for the sin to wash away in the tide, but it reddens the sand, and it stays. This place, where the rocks and crags give way to soft earth and water is where poets have come every night for centuries to find what remains and carry it back up to the grass and trees.   *originally published in Water-Stone Review, Fall 2003 july 18-22 (new york, usa)  I.  the old man with the american flag waving shinily on his black plastic helmet looks triumpant.  he rolls backwards diagonally through a busy intersection, pushing lazily with his one leg.  the going is slow.  one cab driver honks in disbelief.  the other drivers wait very quietly.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 12th time. The tested sentence is:  Tuesday Newsday is a bit lackluster, but here it is.  Do you keep up with the news while on vacation or otherwise away from home for an extended period? If so, how (newspaper/tv, etc.)? And has any major news item ever happened while you were out of touch with the news, shocking you when you found out after the fact?  A little. I trust on hearing it from people. When I backpack or canoe I don't at all, otherwise looking at paper headlines. The closest to a big news item was being on an "academic vacation" when Ronald Reagan died. I guess. Come on, what's with Congress? Why didn't they pass that amendment to ban gay marriage? Because, let's face it, if we allow same-sex marriages, all the people who are in hetrosexual marriages won't be as sanctified. It might rip apart their family life. And those gays can't be for real? It's obvious it's not serious. That's why it's compromising the sanctity of marriage. Unlike the people who get married for a week in Las Vegas as a spur of the moment thing, no, that's OK. And we all know that those homosexuals just totally want everyone to be like them. Bush and co want everyone to be like them, too -- that's why they're passing this amendment -- but it's OK, because they read it in the Bible. And everyone knows this is a Christian country. When we want to be, of course. I mean, when it comes to treating people as you want to be treated, no way! Are you crazy! We're a non-denominational country here. Hellooo? But bring up gay marriage, and then, well, look in the Bible. We have no state religion, you say? Nonsense! Because, that First Amendment doesn't really apply anymore. Come on, read the Patriot Act. Geez.  That last paragraph was my bad attempt at political sarcasm. Just in case you thought my views had radically changed overnight. Here is the major problem with the "Sanctity of Marriage" laws/amendment: it's inhibiting people's freedoms. There are amendments to protect freedoms, there are amendments to protect people and objects. But if gay marriage is allowed, who is it going to hurt? No one. What if it's banned? Who would it hurt then? A lot of people who love each other and obviously feel strongly enough to fight for the right to marry. Banning gay marriage doesn't protect anyone. Even if you think that being gay is wrong and gays try to force their beliefs onto everyone else, banning gay marriage won't change their sexual orientation. We're supposed to be about understanding and giving everyone the freedom to their beliefs. What happened? I wanted to try one of those meme things and found this. It's political, my blog's political... here goes.   1. Is this a fair way to pick a VP? Or might it be more fair to have the person with the second most delegates automatically get the VP slot? Or is there another way to pick a VP that you think would be fair?   Yes, for the most part -- it's like hiring someone to work under you. You don't want to get stuck with someone who you can't work with when you're top banana in the nation. (hee hee -- top banana :)) (what is grammatical rule for doing emoticons in parentheses like last one? anyway...sigh...) No. Then you get into stuff like Adams where they tie and who knows. It stinks working with former competitors. It sounds good at first but I would like to have the choice were I running for pres. This seems like the best way -- other than having me choose it, of course.    2. At one point there were rumors of a Kerry/McCain ticket. As a Democrat who disagrees with most of McCain's views, I wasn't very happy about that. Do you think it's possible to have a split party ticket work?   As a liberal progressive Midwesterner who doesn't pay nearly that much attention to southern politics, I don't really know. I probably would still vote for Kerry -- but then I would vote for a rock if it was against W. McCain did work with Feingold (the greatest senator in the world, the only one with guts enough to vote NO on the PATRIOT Act) on that Campaign Finance Reform, so it might be OK. Though Republicans would totally rip Kerry apart for "not having the courage to choose someone from his own party" etc. Maybe one day it will work. But not this election. It is possible, if they're dynamic and exciting, to have a split ticket work.     3. Does the VP really count for anything? I mean, like, do you know which Presidents had VPs named Alben W. Barkley, Garret A. Hobart or Hannibal Hamlin? Even names you know like Adlai E. Stevenson and Nelson Rockefeller, do you know for whom they were VPs? I know you can look them up on the internet, but did you know, or care?   No, I don't know. No, I don't care. It depends. With Bush, the vice president is everything. They matter more as an issue of charisma and drawing more people in than as a political player once their ticket is elected. But I have the feeling they do a lot behind the scenes. And should the president die... heck, you need someone.   That was tiring :). And a better waste of time than telling you all my favorite movie and such. Now it's off for a walk to break in hiking boots, for next weekend I canoe! I no longer know what to think about 9/11. From a list of very interesting questions I've been reading, it seems as if the government knew a lot more than we thought about the terrorist attacks, and has been not telling the truth about what happened to the towers and who the terrorists were. A sampling to get you thinking:   Why have George Bush and Dick Cheney done everything in their power to stop and derail any investigation into the events of 9/11? Why did it take  15 months  for them to agree to an investigation, and why was Henry Kissinger originally appointed to head it? Why did Bush and Cheney refuse to testify separately or under oath? Whhy was the initial budget into investigating the biggest terrorist attack on American soil only $3 million, while  $70 million  was spent in the fruitless investigation into Bill Clinton's real estate deals?  IN SHORT, WHY WOULD THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ATTEMPT TO DEFEAT AND DERAIL ANY INVESTIGATION INTO 9/11 UNLESS THEY HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE?   If the government claims to have no foreknowledge of the attacks, why could they confidently produce a list of the perpetrators ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ATTACKS and even NAME OSAMA BIN LADEN as the perpetrator within 48 hours? Who exactly hijacked the planes, since 7 of the 19 accused hijackers have been found to be alive? Why does the government NOT CARE WHO HIJACKED THE PLANES?  Why, save the still frame of Mohammed Atta, have we NOT SEEN ANY SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE OF THE TERRORISTS IN THE AIRPORTS? Why have we not seen clear security camera footage of the plane crashing into the Pentagon? WOULD THE PENTAGON HAVE NO SECURITY CAMERAS ROLLING?  We are told that the security frame of Atta (and Abdulaziz al-Omari, one of the hijackers who turned up alive) is them at Portland, Maine's airport. They supposedly flew to Logan and then to the WTC. WHY RISK TRANSFERRING FLIGHTS? WHY NOT FLY DIRECT?  WHY DID THE HIJACKERS DRAW SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES? In Logan  Airport, a man remembers arguing with a Middle Eastern man about a parking space. The car was then found to have flight manuals, a Koran, etc. Atta checked in a bag of flight computers, flying manuals, etc. WHY??? IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY THE ONLY BAG NOT TRANSFERRED ONTO HIS NEXT FLIGHT (Flight 11). WHY THIS COINCIDENCE? WHY DID HE PACK SUCH INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE?  Why did the supposed extremist hijackers behave in such an un-Arab manner? The owner of a strip club rembers loud Middle Eastern mean drinking at his club, saying "America will die tomorrow" etc. WHY, WHEN THIS IS VERY UN-MUSLIM BEHAVIOR? WHY RISK GETTING THEMSELVES NOTICED? WHY DID ATTA'S SUICIDE NOTE SEEM TO BE WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WITH VERY LITTLE FAMILIARITY WITH ISLAM?  HOW DOES A PASSPORT SHOW UP UNHARMED IN THE WTC RUBBLE? Authorities found Satam al-Suqami's passport amidst the rubble. He was flying under a fake ID yet had his real passport. WHY? How did it survive, WHEN THE BLACK BOXES OF ALL OF THE HIJACKED PLANES DID NOT? THEY ARE DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND NEARLY ANYTHING.  How did the terrorists do all this with such precision? Their flight school teachers recall them being STUPID WHEN FLYING A PLANE, and this was a prop plane not a 757. One flight instructor remarked, "I'M STILL AMAZED TO THIS DAY THAT HE COULD HAVE FLOWN INTO THE PENTAGON. HE COULD NOT FLY AT ALL."  Why did President Bush NOT LOOK SURPRISED OR SCARED AT ALL? Even if it was to not scare the kids, or because he is a clueless idiot, WHY WERE THE SECRET SERVICE MEN NOT THERE TO TAKE HIM INSTANTLY TO A SECRET LOCATION? DID THEY KNOW HE WOULDN'T GET HARMED? WHY DID HE MOVE TO AIR FORCE 1, NOT A SECRET GROUND LOCATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SAFER?  Why does the tape of bin Laden confessing look different from the real bin Laden. In quotes, bin laden has said he did not do it. No Muslim group has declared responsibility when usually groups are scrambling to get noticed and take credit for terrorist attacks,  This is similar to project NORTHWOODS, which JFK rejected, in which a ship or jet airliner would be destroyed, supposedly by Cuba, which could then be invaded.  and this is just the beginning. The list goes on pointing out problems with the story regarding Afghanistan, the flights being taken over, the Pentagon destruction, the Towers, and more. I may post more, if you really want me to quickly let me know.    I honestly don't know what to think. Sadly, it sounds plausible that our government could do this. But I don't want to think they would. Though there's so many problems with the story we're told..  And no, I haven't seen Farenheit 911, though I really want to. I found this in "Citizen You" written by one of the Onion writers, and wanted to share it in the hope it may bring joy to your life also.   Making a Difference -- Eight More Years  Since Presidential Appointee George W. Bush was not officially elected in 2000 but appointed by the Supreme Court, the presidential two-term limit does not apply to his first four years in office. Therefore, we will not have to appoint another Bush family member as president until 2012 -- unless, of course, another major terrorist attack occurs on US soil in which case martial law will be enacted and all bets are off. Whoa, whoa, whoa. John Ashcroft and Co. are talking about postponing the elections "should there be a terrorist attack"? Sounds too crazy to be true, I know. But here it is from CNN.com:  WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. officials have discussed the idea of postponing Election Day in the event of a terrorist attack on or about that day, a Homeland Security Department spokesman said Sunday. urlLink (See the full story...)   I mean come on. You've already got Diebold, the largest voting machine manufacturer, on your side, not being required to have a paper trail of the votes in many states; if you can't win with that advantage something is wrong. What do you bet everyone in the White House is hoping that this will be OKed, then on Nov. 1st they set up a terrorist threat and raise the security level to ultrared or whatever. George Bush "expertly deals with the threat" and wins in a landslide on the election which is suitably enough time after his popularity soars. It makes me sick.  Speaking of which, there's some evidence that 9/11 didn't happen like we thought. More on this later. So it's my first real blog post. How awesome. For the most part, I'll be talking politics and opinions here but as my mind deviates you may see some Apple fanaticism, random thoughts, etc. Comments welcome, if anything is grossly wrong with this please bear with me, I've never used this before and I have no idea how easy it will be to use.  And please, no swearing at the blogmaster. . . this is a biased post and I recognize that. It's a sort of 1 web page surrounded by reality (Madisonians will understand that...   About Madison, WI  Madison is a great place to live. We like to brag about it, but also like to keep quiet about it so that the city does not become too popular or overcrowded. It's been called "78 Square Miles Surrounded By Reality".   Without further ado, here I go.  P.S. I just found out that the blogger spellcheck doesn't recognize the word BLOG. How stupid.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 13th time. The tested sentence is:  Several years ago, I went with several friends to Buckhead, which is outside of Atlanta.  We went to several bars looking around having some fun.  We decided to go to this particular one.  We all sat down and there was this big open window.  I sat on the ledge of the window and I was "people-watching" that was walking by.  All of a sudden, I saw this girl riding piggyback on this guy.  I was paid attention to them and they passed by.  As they passed this tree, he tripped and the girl literally flew over him and busted her teeth on the pavement.  After trying to get up, she picked up her broken teeth pieces and put it in her hand.  She was so drunk and had this crazy look on her face, saying, "my teeth... my teeth".  I was laughing so hard.. it was so funny.  I think the guy was trying to console her.  It was so funny that she fell right in front of me.  Wow, that's entertainment at the window!  Here's another story: A co-worker and I decided to walk down to Chik-Fil-A for lunch.  Let me go ahead and give the name... her name is Lavern.  We got our lunch and carried it back to our office.  Lavern wanted to heat up her food in the microwave in the employee lounge.  I said, okay, let's go.  She asked me if she can put the whole thing in the microwave.  I told her as long as there is no metal or aluminum paper in the bag, it was fine.  Well, she put it in and then walked to the other side to get a drink.  I was standing next to the microwave and all of a sudden, I see flames.  Yes, huge flames inside the microwave with sparks.  I was like, oh my gosh, what in the world to do?  I immediately opened the door and tried to blow the fire out.  There is Lavern running over next to me... saying what??? What should I do?  She asked me if she can open her Dr. Pepper or whatever she had and pour on it.  I said, hell no!  Make it bigger!  So, I just pulled the damn thing out of the microwave and patted it out.  It was so embarrassing with all these people standing next to us watching.  Lavern ran out to get the security guard.  What in the world is a security guard going to do, arrest me?  As soon as we got it out, I walked out of the lounge.  Lavern was trying to make this all my fault!  Okay, whatever, I'll take the blame.  Good morning.  I guess I better introduce my harem of women.  Some of you know about it, some of you don't.. so close your jaw.  I can see you with your jaw dropped.  Just close it.  Get over it.

What a weekend!  It sure was wild.  If you read the comments made by Kathy, yes, I helped picked out some undies.  She wanted my opinion.  I have a good opinion... think about it.  The training went well and it went by fast.  It was a good crowd of 39 folks.  When Sandy asked me where we ate in Birmingham, I replied with Wings.  She laughed too hard.  I KNOW I KNOW... that is here in Montgomery as well.  Oh well... we love Wings.  And boy was I full afterwards!  We also went to the Galleria after the training.  Thank goodness we stopped somewhere as I was trying to tighten my seat belt some more... it wouldn't.  It was pouring down rain and Kathy wanted to get the folks out of her way and move!  Ooooh, road rage!  Wifey has a story about road rage... now I am not sure if I want to ride with her or I might get shot!    I bought a boat Sunday.  I was very excited!  After a year, my parents and I finally found a boat.  I am so ready to get it out on the water.  My dad and I doing small things to it to shape it up and then it's set to go!  Gotta get some skis and a tube then we can party hard on the water!  It is blue, my favorite color and has a walk-through.  It can take up to 8 people in it.  I am ready to pull someone on the tube and whip them!  Any volunteers?    Hello!  It's Friday!  It's all I can say.  Time for a relaxing weekend!  Well, most of the weekend.. still got to do that training in Jefferson County.  That shall be fun as Kathy from the office is going with me.  It'll be a wild ride... not too wild, her son is going with us.  I just finished typing the minutes for the Family Support Center today, after procrastinating them for one month!  I am glad we don't have a Board meeting every month.  Just every two months.  I had lunch with Susan today at Felix's.  It was delicious and I know I ate too much, as usual.    To give you information:  Family Support Center is in Prattville, a non-profit organization designed to help others in the community such as GED, parenting, adult education, family-school partnership, job placement, etc.  I am on the Board of Directors as the Secretary/Tresurer.  Susan Cranfield is a great friend of mine and is the Executive Director of the center.  She was my high school teacher and we became good friends.   What else is going on with me... hmmm... let's see... not much but relaxing this evening watching tv, balancing several checkbooks to the penny, paying bills, and watching more tv.  And my two girls are looking at me wanting to go outside... so I better let them out.  Until next time! Good afternoon!  It's almost Friday!  It has been a busy week.  I will be conducting a training this Saturday in Jefferson County at the Sheriff's Academy.  That's a fun Saturday, to be working.  Its not too bad though.  I like to do trainings.    I guess for those of you who don't know me...  I am an accountant for the State of Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Commission and have been with them for four years.  I love my job, but can be stressful at times.  I recently graduated from TSUM with a Masters in Business Administration.    Just two more months until the cruise!  Going with three of my good friends to the Bahamas in September.  My friend Lisa, who is a travel agent with Alabama World Travel, won the cruise and she gets to take three others along.  FUN FUN FUN.  Check out Lisa's website at  urlLink http://djsleeze.blogspot.com  .    Until next time! Good morning all!  What's going on with you?  I am in a co-worker's office this morning.  She says I am anti-social.  Too bad wifey.  I am finally finished with softball this season.  We did pretty bad!  We were ranked #8 out of 12 teams, even made it to the tournament.  We had to play two games in the tournament and lost both games.  I even got to see two bodies slam each other.  And there was a six-month pregnant lady playing on the other team pitching and running.  What a crazy world we are in.  Tell me what's going on with you.  Post me some comments!  Until next time! Hello Everyone!  Welcome to Raoul's World.  I am just trying this out to see if I like it or not... and will have time to do this...  You know me, always busy! Hmmm... seems like there is a guy in my office that is jealous because I helped pick out some panties for the office ho.  Tooooooo bad, Tony!  Get over it.  The ho looks great today... with the right outfit on.. right length skirt and just the right top with the cut down to the cleavage.  Whoooo.. yeah, baby.  Let's get that on!  Let's see... story time.  Got to think of another story.  Not as funny as the others...   We went on a haunted hayride trip.  Several of us from Auburn (while I was in school there) got together to go to Montgomery to go to the Haunted Hayride way out in the country in Montgomery.  My friend Lisa was in charge of this trip.  She got the directions, etc.  There was so many cars (I think around four or five, can't remember).  I was riding with Shannon and her then boyfriend.  Lisa was in front with Carlton, a freak.  I would not ride with him so I got Lisa stuck with him.  I am sorry, Lisa.  Anyway, we got to Montgomery.  We found a fire station and we all pulled over.  Lisa was trying to call for more directions, but nobody would answer.  The person I was riding with was a driving maniac.  On with the story...  we moved on further out and found this dirt road off to the right.  We were on Woodley Road.  We drove down for miles on this dirt road... we could hardly see the car ahead of us.  They were all flying because we could not keep up with Carlton.  He had a big truck.  We turned around and went back to Woodley.  And then went to the other side of Woodley and pulled over at a church.  Turned around again... with Lisa still trying to call the place and no answer.  Then there they go off again, back to that dirt road and went down further.  We finally see the end of the dirt road... mind you, I was holding on to the sides of the Jeep that we were in... holding on for dear life and the wind blasting at the plastic windows.  I probably had a headache, but wasn't paying any attention.  Once we got to pavement, we went on further until the middle of nowhere.  We pulled up in front of this two trailers.. and turned around.  The jeep driver decided to pull off and drive up the bankment and couldn't get all the way up.  I thought we were going to flip over.  I am so glad we didn't.   Anyway, after all of us turned around, we started off again, really fast.  All of a sudden, we were all stopped in the middle of the road, lined up one behind the other.  I couldn't figure out what was going on!  Then I happen to look on the side of the road and there was a deer, trying to live.  Yes, Carlton hit the deer and scared the shit out of Lisa.  He was so mad that it dented the bumper of his truck.  Shannon was yelling, let's get the hell out of here.. my life is more important than that deer.  Carlton had to put the deer out of misery.  Poor deer.  We decided to go back to Auburn as it was over an hour just driving around.  Oh, point in fact, there was this big woman out on the porch of the trailer looking at all of us in her nightgown.  Just standing there watching all of these people all over the road.  Good grief.  We went on back through the dirt road and to a gas station in town.  The cars were filled with yellow dust.  We had to wash the windshields to see better.  Carlton had to call home to report the accident and Lisa got out and got into another car, with her eyes so wide.  So, did we ever have the haunted hayride?  Or, was that the haunted ride?

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 14th time. The tested sentence is:  Why Good Girls Always Want the Bad Boys By Laura Snyder  "I just want a nice guy," women whine. Then they date the first drunken leather-clad jerk who spills his drink on her dress. What gives? Well, it's more than just because "nice" is generally considered shorthand for "boring sex." Here's why some babes love the allure of the bad boy.  It's Genetic  All of human history - and thus, our genetic programming -- rewards those brave enough to take risks. The cowardly caveman died in his lonely cavern, while the brave one ventured out and survived. Sure, the "dangerous" caveman might not be as pleasant to sit with by the fire at night, but he appealed to the cavewoman because he'd pass along stronger genes.  It's All In Our Heads  What's so sexy - and makes us feel so good - about being with the bad boy? For starters, he's got confidence, and that's sexy because it's a sign of strength. But there's more: dating the bad boy carries an element of risk. And risk triggers the production of the feel-good brain chemical dopamine. We may be intrigued by his notorious drug and alcohol problems (and he probably has 'em), but it's really our own "drugged" nervous system that does us in.  We Love a Challenge  Women love to play relationship therapist (just listen in on a conversation with our girlfriends if you need proof). In order to achieve this, we need to find a jerk to lie down on our couch. We love the idea of being the woman who solves this mysterious man's problems and turns him into our own Prince Charming.  We Know What to Expect  With bad boys, we know what to expect. We'll try to change them, it won't work, and we'll be left heartbroken. But, it will be entirely not our fault. Whereas if we date Mr. Nice Guy and doesn't work out, we're going to have to take some ownership of the failure. Some women are just more comfortable playing the victim.  ## urlLink Iconoclast :: Manage Posts urlLink Iconoclast :: Manage Posts urlLink Iconoclast :: Manage Posts The Newsroom Iconoclast  Adidas, and the power of 'the Rule of Threes'  Sunday, July 4, 2004     By Michael J. Bowers           As I have written before, I don't love Germany like I did as a kid, when my family was living in a little town called Hohenecken and every block was a new, exotic adventure.            The Germans' petulance last year on the way to a just war settled all those memories for good.           However, there is one thing German that I still covet: the three stripes of Adidas.  The design, which appeared in 1949, is simple, elegant and exquisitely satisfying.           On a gym shoe like the Gazelle or the Samba, the stripes produce a classic. And a wise man knows that when you have a classic, you don't mess with it.           You might compare it to another example of great German design: the Porsche 911. On the road today, the car has the same essential shape that it had when it was born in 1963. It has been revised a little over the years, but that's all.           Knowingly or not, the engineers in Stuttgart understand something that an old diplomat once said: "Sometimes when it is not necessary to do anything, it is necessary to do nothing."           Part of the beauty of the Adidas stripes lies in the Rule of Threes. Jason Meyers writes about communication technology for Primedia Business Magazines. But he knows the rule embraces all fields of human endeavor:           "Dividing things into threes is universally acceptable," he says. "There's Aristotle's principle of the three unities of time, place and action. There's Freud's id, ego and superego. There's the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."           And so on. The rule also applies to jokes. Most have three acts. The first establishes the pattern. The second reinforces the pattern. The third twists the pattern to produce the punch line.            Along the same lines, a good copy editor knows that when you must use a pseudo-word such as "argggh," it is necessary to stop at three g's. Why?           Well, because.           Two g's is not enough.           Four is too many.            "Arggh" does not satisfy, and "arggggh" overfills.            But "argggh"? That hits the mark.           For all its design intelligence, Adidas has fallen prey to one fallacy. They think spelling their name with a small initial letter ("adidas") is cute or something.            It's not. It's hokey. It's so Seventies, like earth shoes and mood rings and those detaching pop-tops that we used to drop into our soda with such breathtaking recklessness.           My college newspaper used to call itself "the daily illini." Once the logo might have looked avant-garde. But no more. We looked at it and thought "yuk." We capitalized the name and never went back.           It's time for Adidas to do the same thing. In the meantime, adidas and other irritating names, such as k.d. lang and thirtysomething, have produced a schism on newspaper copy desks across the nation.           The purist copy editor â€” and there's nothing wrong with the purist copy editor â€” says that if shoe companies and pop singers and television shows spell their names stupidly, then the newspaper is obliged to follow suit.           On the other side, the grumpy and impatient copy editor (me) says:           "Look, I don't have time for this nonsense. We are an English-language newspaper, and in the English language, proper nouns are capitalized. So adidas is going to become Adidas, and if they don't like it, too bad."           The debate has yet to be resolved.           Another divisive Adidas issue is pronunciation.           My sister and I discovered the shoe in summer 1974, our last year in Germany, in an outlet store that was chockablock with stripes.           We loved the shoes, we bought the shoes, and we pronounced the name the way the Germans do: AH-dee-dos.           But in the fall we moved back to the States and discovered our new schoolmates insisted the pronunciation was uh-DEE-dus. We thought they were so stupid. We had just got back from Germany! We knew!           But in the face of 170 million Americans pronouncing Adidas wrong, what could we do? Were our ears wrong? Should we be right and be thought stupid, or should we be wrong and be thought smart?           Thirty years later, I was still conflicted. I avoided speaking the word at all.  Then one day recently I remembered that I had a friend in Cologne, Germany, who naturally would know the answer. I sent her an urgent e-mail: AH-dee-dos or uh-DEE-dus?           Ully wrote back: "Both a's are pronounced like the u in umbrella. The i is pronounced like ee in week. Stress is on the first syllable."           In other words, for Mary and me, our ears had been correct all these years. This was a relief. But still there was the conflict about whether to speak wrong or be thought wrong.           Ully advised: "Play dumb, like I do with that word in the States. You stand no chance against the majority, unless you want be perceived as a prig.            "It's the same over here," she added. "People pronounce the terms 'online' and 'Excel' (software) on the first syllable. 'Excel' doesn't even make sense when you pronounce it that way, but if you say it correctly, nobody knows what you're talking about."           I decided she was right. Which brings us back to where we started, the Rule of Threes. I conclude that when it comes to Adidas:           --Pronounce it the American way.           --Capitalize it.           --And don't add a fourth stripe.           ## Young Muslim woman strives to reconcile her two worlds  Sunday, July 18, 2004  By Michael J. Bowers   After hearing for several weeks about the mean debate over whether three Muslim men should be allowed to build a mosque in Orland Park, I decided to attend the climactic village board meeting on June 21.   I expected bitterness, and I got it. Forty-four people, most of them opposed to the mosque, addressed the board. Some of the things they said embarrassed me.   On the other hand, a few mosque supporters said things I thought were unnecessarily hostile.   In other words, neither side was completely right, and neither side was completely wrong.    The debate is now moot, of course. The board voted unanimously to approve the mosque plan.  Indisputably, it was the right thing to do. Construction will begin by September.    In the meantime, one moment stands out: when 23-year-old Huda Krad, daughter of one of the mosque founders, addressed the hecklers.    "I am so scared right now," she said in a voice that trembled just slightly. To many, she said, the mere fact she wears a head covering makes her a "degraded creature."   "I was born and raised in this country," she said. Yet, "I feel there is nothing I can say to people here to convince them I am a good person."   Huda's words reminded me of "The Elephant Man," the 1980 movie about the Englishman John Merrick.  Merrick was born in 1862. As a child, he developed an unsightly facial growth that earned him scorn and cruelty.   The climax comes when a group of men chase the adult Merrick into a train station. He turns and confronts his tormentors: "I am not an animal! I am a human being! I ... am ... a man!"   Not to say Huda is unsightly. Far from it. However, I heard in her words in Orland Park in 2004 the same fear that John Merrick must have felt at the hands of unthinking people in London in the late 1880s.   And I wondered what it must be like to grow up with one foot in secular America and the other in Islam.    So one pleasantly cool night recently, Huda and her parents graciously welcomed me into their home on a quiet street in Palos Heights.    The four of us talked about many compelling issues. But eventually the conversation turned to the central issue: the mosque.    I congratulated the family on their success, and I acknowledged a few of the opponents were a bit ignorant.    But still, I said, do not these people deserve a little bit of understanding? Are there not many Muslims in America who do resent their host country?   I gave a couple of examples. It pained the Krads to hear them, and it pained me to speak them. But I think the issue is central to the conflict. It must be discussed.   One example came from a report in the Arizona Republic from November 2001. A 22-year-old man named Moayaad Hamad, wearing a Polo shirt, Nikes, Levi's jeans and a cell phone, said:  "It's getting to the point where I hate being here. â€¦ I don't think many (Muslims) are willing to say this, because they are afraid to say it. â€¦ The Koran doesn't justify taking out the World Trade Center, but Islam means not just peace, but freedom. You have to defend yourself."   Here Huda's father, Mohamed, spoke up: "I think Americans have all the right to be scared. I am scared myself. bin Laden would call me an infidel."   Huda added that Muslims are engaged in a fierce struggle over who owns Islam. The killers have seized the good name of her religion.   "They changed the name, and they manipulated the name, and they spit it back at the people," she said.   "And now we have to reclaim the name."    Here I realized radical Islam despises not only the West; it also despises any Muslim who dares cooperate with the West. In Baghdad, these three wonderful people would be marked for kidnapping just as soon as I.    Huda believes peaceful Muslims eventually will win the struggle. She passionately believes the solution is simple: People like Moayaad Hamad, the resentful young Muslim man in Arizona, must replace their ignorance with education.   I believe her. But in the meantime, I fear many more good people will suffer violent death. A few days after we met, I discussed my conclusion with Huda by e-mail.    Huda was disappointed. "After sitting with you and talking about this," she said, "I'm saddened that I could not instill more hope for you. â€¦ Hope is what the people of Orland Park need now."   But, Huda, I said: My conclusion is pessimistic because I am pessimistic. For example, a London Guardian poll taken in March shows that 13 percent of British Muslims believe another attack like 9-11 would be justified.   Huda, give me reason to hope, I said. Convince me.    Huda responded by citing the Civil War. "President Lincoln had many around him that spoke of all the death that was happening." Blood flowed in rivers. "How many people asked the question, 'How many more people have to die?'   "And when they asked that question, why didn't Lincoln share in their pessimism? I'll tell you why. Because he didn't look at the situation through a microscope. ... He looked at the situation with a greater vision."   Hope is not an option, Huda said. It is an obligation. It is essential for change. Without hope, failure is guaranteed.   And so I promised Huda I would hope.   I will hope even more when we finish off the resistance in Iraq.    I'm not sure, but I think Huda would agree with me.   ##

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 15th time. The tested sentence is:  Nothing of interest has happened yet. Just thought you'd like to know. Ever get paint on the clothes of your department's director? Yeah, that's how my night went. Maybe I should start carrying a bucket of cold water with me? Just in case I see the need to drown myself on a moment's notice. Have you ever noticed how what one generation grew up with becomes kitsch for the next generation? Today, I went shopping for a Messenger Bag (ended up having an eye exam instead, but that's a different story). In my search, I walked by two displays. One was an Old Navy display that had old Route 66 type slogans and adverts on them. The type of things my parents would have seen on television as they were watching 1950's TV. The second was a Hot Topic display. On sale there were t-shirts advertising Transformers, not the new crappy show mind you, but the old, "Me Grimlock, you lunch" Transformers. Somehow, I wonder why kids, and let's face it, if anyone over the age of 14 walked into a Hot Topic for any other reason than to apply for a job, I'd be amazed; would want to wear a t-shirt from a show they've never seen. Maybe I'm just getting old. Yesterday, I really had the urge to get out of my ridiculously small apartment and go somewhere. So, I decided to head downtown and visit Chinatown. After all, I hadn't been to Chinatown in while and figured I could pick up some good Pot Stickers. Okay kiddies, the next time I get the urge to go somewhere, for God's sake, please shoot me.       Within 5-minutes of walking in through the Grant Street entrance, I realized why it had been so long since my last visit.... the Tourists. Yes, the dreaded Tourists. And since it's summer over here in the States, that means that a whole mess load of Tourists, complete with little brats, were running around, going in and out of the shops screaming their little lungs off.       "Mommy, Daddy, I want one of these."     "Uh, honey, that's not a toy."     "But look, it says Hello Kitty on it, and it vibrates!"     *stoned silence*     (NB: I actually overheard this conversation)       Next time I go to Chinatown, I'm going at night, for food, or the Chinese New Year parade. They're small, colored, although the old ones are mostly white, and hold vast amounts of music, information, and even some games. In my life, I've seen some great things: The personal computer, the Internet, the Mariners with a winning season, the rise and fall of the PDA, cellular phones, readily available Anime in the US, another winning season for the Mariners, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, free webcomics, Spider-Man 1 and 2, etc, etc....       But the I-Pod is the first that I've never wanted to leave home without. Easy to use, easy to update, convenient, and well, cool. I feel 10+ cooler just wearing one and I'm one of those people who projects an invisible shield that automatically repels people. I'm not even that big of a Mac person (though I do admit a secret love for their laptops). Too damn cool. On the other hand, maybe it's just because it's still a relatively new toy for me. Maybe, after a few months, I'll get tired of it and relegate it to the "there but barely used pile of electronics." Then again, maybe not.         On a completely unrelated note. I'm wondering if the the term "Windows XP" isn't a code of some sort. Something like XP stands for eXperience Points and windows is a English translation for the number of points needed to de-bug the damn system, which would be: 239,144,152,319 eXperience Points. Crap, I don't think I'm there yet.     Today's link:  urlLink  Fun with Music I'm at work right now, which means that I shouldn't be typing this. Quite frankly, I don't care, no one here is every going to see this anyhow. Now, how can I put this.... I'm bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored.   Working nights is a pain in the arse. Working nights on the weekends is like getting violated in places where the sun does not shine. I could be out on the town, meeting girls, having fun, drinking heavily, but no; I'm here, at work, high on caffeine, and full from Chin... oh, crap, someone's coming in.     5-minutes later: Okay, he's gone. Anyway, as I was saying: high on caffeine and full from the plate of Chinese style Pot Stickers. My supervisor is giving a promotion's test, so I'm basically running the show for the time being, which is cool, except that I'd rather be getting a lot more money for the job. Late.         01:23, 07/25/2004  Sometimes, I really hate this job. Everything was nice and quiet and then.... boom! I've spent the last hour on the phone and radio talking back and forth, basically acting as a go-between for three different groups of people. There are times when I wish I could just roll over and go to sleep, sleepy, sleepy, sleep.      *zzzzzzzzzzzzzz* You ever have one of those days where you just can't go to sleep? No matter how tired you are? It is now 10:17 on a Saturday morning and I've been up since 05:00 on Friday. In between, I've closed my eyes for about 20-minutes.... tops. I'm so tired that the world is spinning and everything is begining to fall apart before my very eyes. The 6th Cav painting above my futon... upside down. The Irish flag, now starting to look vaguely British.      Okay, so It's partially my fault. I mean, I supposed I could go to sleep if I just lay my head down on my pillow and closed my eyes. Two problems. One: Caffeine. I have more caffeine in my veins than blood. This isn't a new problem mind you. It's just one that affects me from time to time.     Two:   urlLink  Strange Candy.      This comic will kill your brain, and make you laugh hysterically. Or, just fall on the floor and roll around for a while.      That's it, I'm going to go and read some more.... maybe, if I'm really lucky, unconsciousness will overtake me sometime in the near future.... maybe. Welcome. If you're reading this, which, I have to presume you are, then you've stumbled upon my blog. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't have much to say right now besides two things:         I'm drunk, and it's 17:55 hours on a Thursday, suprised I can still type?         Idependence Day is a really corny movie. Did you know that Will Smith was offered the part of Neo. Can anyone really see Smith-san saying "There is no spoon."?     Well, that's it for today. Check back later, maybe I'll feel like posting more. Until then, enjoy. Lately, I've become obsessed with finding wallpapers for my desktop. I already had a whole mess of them, but with the recent revival of   urlLink  4Chan   and my more recent re-discovery of   urlLink iichan  , I've been downloading them off of image boards like there's no tomorrow. It's almost sickening. In the past week, I've changed my desktop wallpaper and layout at least twice. Though, I think I'm finally happy with the current layout... at least for another week or two.      I've remove all my shortcut icons except for the Recycle Bin (which Windows XP won't allow me to remove) and pinned the shortcuts I use the most to my "Start" menu. One: it allows me to see more of my desktop, which is nice since I use a 1280x1024 pixel image on my screen. Two: It looks better. I've always hated shortcut icons. Despite their hadiness, I've always preferred having as few on my desktop as possible. Sadly, I'm using a lot more programs on a frequent basis then I was when I first started using 'puters.  Ergo, I've been having to use a lot more shortcuts. But, I finally decided to just pin them to the menu. I realize this is pointless, but quite frankly, I was downloading a new program and I was bored. Late. So, it's been a while since I wrote anything in this blog. For this, I apologize. Of course, I don't know why I'm apologizing, since I don't actually think anyone reads this blog. So, if you do, I'm sorry. You may ask, to what am I apologizing? Well, both.... for not writing, and for you reading this blog.  I just took a new job. It' s not bad. The pay is about the same, but it's a regular job, which is nice.  Anyway, it's supposed to run for about 9- hours a day. This has been my first week. Total, I've worked 43-hours and there's still one-day left in the week. I'm exhausted... E.X.H.A.U.S.T.E.D..  Anyway, I'm going away now. Bye. I got a new job. It's at the same place, but it's an actual, honest-to-goodness Monday thru Friday job. I mean, the 3 and 4-day weekends were great, but it would be kinda nice to actually have Saturday and Sunday off like everyone else. Not to mention that it's really hard to meet a member of the female persuassion when you're work schedule is bucked the hell up. I mean, imagine the conversation:      Me: "So, you want to go out this week?"    Her: "Sure, how about Saturday night?"    Me: "Uh, that won't work, I work on Saturday night, every Saturday night."    Her: "Loser."      And there endeth the conversation. I bought a new bag today, after my previous "cheap as hell, on sale from the Gap" bag failed to fufill it's general purpose; namely, not tearing my neck from my shoulders. The new bag is a nice large flapdoozy tech from a NY based store called YakPak, but's that not important, I just figured that someone out there might want to check out their on-line store,  urlLink YakPak.com ; anyway, my previous bag shopping trips have been fairly simple expiditions, go to Target, or some other equally generic place and buy whatever was on-sale at the time. However, this bag was different. I put research into this bag. I Googled examples from the web, compared prices, shopped around for what was in the City, compared features, and finally, posted notes on forums and IRC channels to see if there was any feedback. In short, I put work into finding this bag.    I did all this because it came to me that I really need a bag, just for daily living. It carries my various notebooks, pens, pencils, calculator, cleaner for my glasses, whatever book I happen to be reading at the time, my cell phone, and my I-pod (see http://thisthinghere.blogspot.com for my love of I-pods), among other items. All of which are pretty much essential for my "21st century digital-boy" lifestyle; (first person who can tell me where that quote came from wins a... nice e-mail). if I had a laptop, it would go in there as well, and the only reason I don't have a laptop is that I have other things that I need to spend $1000 on, not that I want to, but some things are inevatable, like new timing belts.    The point of this seemingly pointless e-mail is this: Congratulations ladies, you won. Equality is here, men now can not live without bags to carry all our shit. Random Link:  urlLink Ninja Burger I'm tired........, so tired........, I'm tired of being here, so tired. I'm spread......, so thin........., I don't know where I am...      Actually, I do; and that's the problem. I've had a total of 5 hours of sleep in the past 48 and it's starting to wear on me. Like today. I went to bed at around 09:00 or so (when you work a grave shift, one's sleep schedule is a mess). Anyway, that seemed like a good time to crash out, but then woke up about 3-hours later and couldn't get back to fucking sleep. So now, I want to sleep, but of course I can't since I'm working. I know, I'm just whining, but dammit, you'd whine if you'd been up too  bloody  long too!

Unfortunately, I can only go to Wal Mart when someone volunteers to give me a ride.  Oh well, no biggy.  I'll get there.  Well it's time for breakfast now.  And maybe some video games.  Later on!    God bless you. Perspective, or the ability to perceive things in their actual interrelations or comparative importance, can be quite hard to grasp sometimes.  I learned a lot just about five minutes ago.  My mom's friend gave birth to a son recently, and today our family was babysitting him.  He's so cute, just a little guy.  We were also babysitting his older brother, who is now about a year old.  Up until today, I always thought of his older brother as a baby.  But when I saw them side by side, I realized that this was not true.  Or if still a baby, he is definitely at a different stage in his baby life.  He looked so huge compared to his baby brother!  It really made me think about how we see things, and how much our view of things can change when compared to something else.  Then the lesson was really pounded home.  My "kitten" Lux, who I always thought of as a tiny little cat, is  bigger  than the baby!  It all just goes to show that you should never view something from only one side.  Or maybe that everything is always changing.  Whatever the moral of this story is, I'm glad I learned it.  Praise God for showing us such amazing things!  He is so worthy to be praised!  Well, I'm going to bed now...  three posts today, wow.  I'll catch ya on the flip side!    God bless you. I'm home alone and Maria is at work, so basically I have nothing to do.  Well, that's not entirely accurate.  I  could  go take a shower.  Yeah, I really should do that.   I made an amazing revelation today.  Ska is a form of reggae.  Who knew?  Oh well, I like it hahaha.   Now for the real reason that I made this post.  I just wanted to see what my blog page thing would look like with two posts on it lol.  Am I pathetic, or what?  Oh well, I don't care.  Catch ya later!    "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power.  For you created all things, and it is by your will they exist and were created."  -Revelation 4:11          God bless you. Well, I'm starting to get pumped up for LIFE 2004.  Since this is my first post, I'll fill you in on what LIFE is.  My youth group will be heading for Phoenix, AZ on Monday morning to gather together with tens of thousands of teenagers for a week long convention, where we are going to worship our Lord Jesus Christ through music, concerts, services, seminars and much more!  As you can imagine, I'm a little bit excited for it!  The only thing that scares me is the flight to Phoenix.  I've never been on a plane before.  But Maria tells me that it's going to be okay, and that I'm going to survive and that I'll be back in Pennsylvania in a little over a week!  I don't know if I believe that yet.  Well, I haven't showered today, so I think I might just do that now.  I'm new to the whole blog thing, so if I have more than one post today, it's because I am excited at the fact that I have this online journal type thing.  It's kind of cool, I must say.  I'll conclude with a quote I made up, and I think everyone should hear...       "Even though the clouds may be gray, the sky above is  always  blue."        God bless you all. If I could describe my life to you in two words, I have just done it.  I'll do it again.  Band Camp.  8 am to 3 pm every single day.  Not that I don't like it, because I do.  I don't really have a lot to say though.  Tonight, I'm selling my speakers, and hopefully going to make eighty dollars.  So I'm looking forward to that.  Me and my sister are going to try to put our money together and buy one of those motor bikes from Wal Mart.  Wish us luck in that.  Well, I think I'm going to check my email now, and then make a prayer list.  I'll catch ya later.    God Bless you. Yesterday, as some of you may know, was Friday the 13th.  So my sister and I decided to get a group of kids together and honor the dead.  We went to the old Catholic cemetery in Clearfield around 8 pm.  First we fixed a few tombstones that had fallen over.  Unfortunately we couldn't fix them all, as some of them were too heavy to budge, even with four people lifting.At 9 pm the church bell rang.  We could barely hear it, because the races were too loud.  But we did hear it.  After it was done we gathered together and I gave a speech.  These are the exact words...       "To the Dead, now on this, the thirteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord two-thousand four, we gather here together to honor your lives, mourn your deaths, and patiently await your resurrection in Christ Jesus.  Amen."  After the speech, we shone our flashlights on every tombstone we could see.  We tried not to miss any.  The dead even got a fireworks show last night, even though I'm not sure where the fireworks were coming from.  The amazing thing about the whole night was that it made us all feel like we had done something good, and big, something we couldn't understand.  Maybe something we didn't need to understand.  But I'll tell you one thing, that cemetery feels so alive.  It's strange.  I'm not sure what I believe about ghosts or spirits yet.  I can only turn to the Bible for answers, so that is where I will turn.  But if those spirits really were there, I bet they appreciated what we did for them.    God bless you all, living and dead. Whoo!  Sitting on a plastic lawn chair playing Game Boy for eight hours a day at the fair will pay off today!  Literally.  Hahaha.  I am almost scared.  I'm not used to having money.  I don't even remember what money is used for.  Maybe I will remember someday.  I am going on a date tomorrow!  I'll update this later, I have to go take my mom for soap powder now.  Catch ya later!    God Bless you. Today was a lazy day.  I haven't showered, I haven't seen my girlfriend, and I ate a lot.  Mat came over today, which was a pleasant thing.  I feel bad though, because I told Maria I would call her, and I didn't.  I'm going to have to apologize next chance I get.  I've done a lot of apologizing today.  I just hope I can get forgiven by certain people.  I think I need to examine my own opinions and sympathies, because it seems lately I have offended a lot of people.  Pray for me in that.  I'll update this again soon, tomorrow probably.  I'll catch ya later.    God Bless you. Hey, the fair is over, which means once again I am out of a job.  I met Clay Aiken's tour bus, by making it turn around and leave my entrance.  Clay Aiken is a big baby by the way.  Tonight at the fair, his dinner was ten minutes late, so he threw his plate of spaghetti across the room and upended a table, followed by a childish fit.  Very mature.  And then to top it all off, this chic called me a jerk simply because I told her all the stuff Clay did that was quite loserish.  She's so obsessed with his hottness that she couldn't even see the way he was acting.  She told me "stars need special treatment...  you wouldn't understand."  Right.  I forgot that famous people are better than normal people, just because they were blessed with a voice.  I can't help it that Clay Aiken's tour bus is larger and more amazing than my house!  (that's not a lie)  Well, I'm mad now that I was so insulted by that girl.  I'm outta here.  In future blogs I will try to refrain from complaining.  It's not good, and I'm kind of sorry that I've done it now.  But I'm gonna post this anyway, because I don't want to retype it all.  have a nice night!    God bless you. I have returned from Phoenix, and I'm so tired that I can barely function.  I have to do fair parking today, it hurts my heart a little because Maria in her past three emails told me she couldn't wait to see me today, and unfortuneately, we cannot be together on this day.  That sucks.  By the way, for the kid who asked, Maria is my girlfriend, so now you know who she is.  I just wish I could see her today, but I guess there's nothing that can be done about it.  I'm exhausted, so I'm gonna wrap this up.  God is amazing, there's no denying it.  In future blogs, I will try to tell some of the amazing things I experienced at LIFE in arizona.  But until then, see ya later!   God bless you.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 17th time. The tested sentence is:  i am leaving for chicago tomorrow at 8am. my parents are crazy about being everywhere early, especially when flights are concerned, so we are leaving for providence (which is about a 45 minute drive...) at 5:45 am. i know you are supposed to get to airports early but my god. anyway, connecticut is boring and i am looking forward to moving on. a quick recap of my time here:  yesterday (tuesday): hung out all day in the hammock on the back porch. did some laundry. started reading "go figure (va savoir)". its a book by a quebec author about a guy who is renovating a house in the country while his wife is travelling around europe with his former mistress (or girlfriend...im not sure). so far so good. my mom made a big dinner (the only one while i was home) of roast chicken and potatos and whatnot. my mom sure makes a mean gravy. at night went to see the killers at the call in providence. the show was supposedly sold out in advance but i drove up anyway hoping to buy a ticket off of someone. mapquested directions as i had never been then. the directions turn out to be totally wrong and i end up completely lost in downtown providence. providence is not layed out in blocks and i should also mention that they do that thing where the same street will change names. yeah thats annoying. anyway i ask a coupld of people if they know where the call is or if they've heard of elbow street (the street on which its allegedly located...) and everyone looks at me like im insane. anyway i drive around for a bit and ask a random woman on the corner if she knows where it is and she starts to give me directions, but its kinda complicated and then the light changes and people start honking, so shes all like im going that way, i swear im not a serial killer, can i get in i'll just show you where it is. she turns out to be super nice and had heard about the show on the radio. we get a little bit lost because she walks everywhere and streets are one way and stuff but anyway we find it eventually. there is even parking right across the street. she was on her way to another nearby bar to watch the red sox kick the crap out of toronto (go sox), so i told her that i would come join her if i couldnt get a ticket. turns out there were tickets at the door. it was only 6 bucks and the place wasnt even packed. the club was pretty small for them too, probably about 2-300 capacity. the opening band was the everyones from australia. poppy. not bad. picked up a free sampler, havent checked it out yet. the killers take super long to set up. the finally get on and only play for like half an hour plus a 2 song encore. kinda short but i guess they only have one album. they were pretty good live. not much to look at but they played great and the drummer rocked out like hell. they didnt play the only non-single that i really really like a lot (track 5, all the things i've done) until the last song of the encore and i couldnt remember the name to yell for it and i was sure they werent gonna play it, but they did. close one.  monday: did pretty much nothing. hung out for a bit at  urlLink the mystic disc . i worked there a bit years ago, before i moved to montreal. very solid little store with lots of good vinyl. very high fidelity. talked some baseball with rich. later went for a drink with my dad at  urlLink margaritas , this super cheesy mexican restaurant in mystic. i was tempted to get a burrito, but i am holding out for california, or at least chicago. did have some good fried ice cream as well as my new favorite mexican beer  urlLink modelo especial .  sunday: played whiffleball. my friend rich freitas (of the mystic disc as well as the band  urlLink low beam ) organizes a weekly game of whiffleball in noank. they take is pretty seriously and there is a  urlLink website  with stats and everything. its pretty hardcore, check it out. i hit one out in my first at bat, and also had a bunch of singles and a couple walks. i also struck out had a sac fly and fell down while running from first to second. go me. after the game i brought home a bbq chicken pizza from  urlLink mystic pizza  (amazing...will someone please bring real pizza to montreal?) and watched the extended version of almost famous with my mom. god i love that movie.  saturday: drove to new haven and took  urlLink metro north  to grand central. went to  urlLink MOMA at PS1  in long island city, queens to see  urlLink the ryan mcginley show . it kinda sucked. had to pay 8 bucks instead of the usual 2 because there was some sorta benefit beach party going on with djs and stuff, which meant it was really crowded and i got to look at the art with techno/dance music thumping away outside. after that i busted it over to randalls island (aka worst place on earth) for  urlLink little steven's underground garage fest . scored a ticket from a dude outside the 125th st subway in harlem for 20 bucks, saving 5 off the door price. booyah. met up with jasamine and lisa at the show. got free iced lattes courtesy of dunkin donuts. caught some of the raveonettes, and all of the pretty things, new york dolls, strokes and iggy and the stooges. strokes and stooges were both amazing. 20 bucks very well spent and the hurricane held off until the show was pretty much over. waited forever with like 5000 people for the bus back to manhattan and busted it over to  urlLink north six  in willamsburg for  urlLink matt pond pa . caught most of their set. wow. really. great band. i had only ever heard like one or two tracks but live they totally blew me away. also the cellist/keyboard player was not unattractive at all. cait smith was there with a couple of her friends, so all took the subway back to manhattan to catch our respective last trains. grabbed a hot dog and a pretzel outside of grand central. why do we not have street vendors in montreal??? WHY???  friday: i think i did nothing. may have hung out in downtown mystic at the disc and/or the green marble (a cafe that i spent most of ages 15-18 hanging out at/around). came home, went on the internet a lot.  thursday: woke up early and went to boston with my dad. caught the red sox-devil rays day game at fenway. wow. scalpers were asking 60 bucks US for bleacher seats. baseball in boston is insane. we missed the first inning and a half, but finally found a guy (not a scalper) with 2 extras who sold them to us for face value (45 apiece). scizzore. sweet seats too. first level 11th row granstands just on the first base side of home (still behind the net). pedro threw a gem. 10 Ks, 6 hits, no walks, complete game. fenway is amazing. the seat are super small tho. on a side note, does noone work in boston? it was one in the afternoon on a thursday and there was not an empty seat in the stadium. after the game we hit up  urlLink newbury comics  on newbury and i picked up the killers album as well as the first  urlLink planes mistaken for stars  EP which was stolen from me years ago. PMFS are like crusty grind now or something, but their first EP is melodic and i like it a lot. you can hear a couple of songs  urlLink here . just scroll all the way down. i recommend "copper and stars". then we went to newport RI where my dads band (dave howard and the high rollers...cant find the site URL...will get back to you on that...) was playing at the  urlLink blues cafe . the band was very decent. for those of you who dont know, my dad is a hawt piano/organ player. the blues cafe weirdly enough is where i was introduced to modelo especial. anyway, newport is like this ritzy seaside sorta town where they used to hold the americas cup races every four years for like a hundred years until australia or new zealand or whatever won it and took it down there sometime in the 80s. its a big sailing place. rich people from new york used to summer there and there are all these crazy huge manions everwhere that are referred to as "cottages". gotta love old money. anyway i found the one record store in town and because i guess nobody in newport listens to indie rock i found a bunch of sweet promos in the used section for under 5 bucks (constantines, solea, sam roberts, cave in, pretty girls make graves, saddle creek 50 comp, ryan adams, etc....10 cds for 30 bucks). im broke tho so i might sell a bunch of them to  urlLink amoeba  in san francisco. i should be able to make a profit on some of them. i forget the name of the store, but its right in the main part of town by the water. when in newport check it out.  wednesday: hung out in downtown mystic. went to get an iced coffee at bess eaton (a southern new england donut chain...) only to find out that bess eaton had gone bankrupt and been bought by TIM HORTONS. how weird is that? tim hortons is now all over new england. at least they have iced coffee here. hung out that night with my friend mallory and drank some busch lite in cans. god bless america. mallory had gotten trashed the previous night and tried to make herself falafel while drunk only to end up severely burning her arm and hand with hot oil, so i spent most of the night watching her drain blisters on her arm and bandage it up. sweet. she did however get prescibed vicodin for the pain. her roomates cat just had kittens so there were like 7 little insane but very cute cats running all over the place doing insane things that i cant remember. it was entertaining at the time. like periodically they would get their claws stuck on this curtain thing that was serving as a door and they would just sorta swing back and forth on it until they freed themselves. for those keeping score at home mallory was party to the "incident" which led to nathan leaving full count mid tour last summer. she is also a very decent singer/songwriter. she played me a couple of songs and i was impressed. sorta cat powerish. she also works at the green marble.   a note on the jew bus: i took the jewish bus from new york to montreal monday night/tuesday morning. what an experience. i highly recommend it if at all possible. i called up to reserve my spot and the guy cross examined me about my jewishness, all asking what synagogue i belonged to and stuff. anyway i made it up saying i belonged to a temple beth-israel in connecticut. that seemed to satisfy him. anyway i googled it and it turns out there is actaully a  urlLink temple beth israel in hartford  and it is the largest reform congregation in connecticut or something. sweet. go me. anyway, the bus was insane. it was totally full and everyone was speaking yiddish. YIDDISH! who speaks yiddish?? i was also the only male on the bus without a kippah. women and men had to sit separately (women in the back...) and this one girl who i guess was not super religious tried to get on in a tank top and the woman yelled at her to cover up and put on a sweatshirt. we stopped in this weird little village called kiryas joel about an hour outside of new york that was all hasidic jews. who knew? me and one other guy got off at penn station in manhattan and everyone else was going either to this village or to brooklyn. weird.  anyway....its 3 am and i gotta be up at like 5:15 so ima hit the sack...i will update from chicago... i am at my parents house in mystic (well technically ledyard...which is pronounced ledge-urd for those of you keeping score at home...). i took the jewish bus from a random corner on the border between outremont and tmr last night at 10 and got into penn station around 6 this morning. more about the bus ride later. chilled out at penn for an hour, had a krispy kreme donut and 15 minutes later a salt bagel. purchased about 30 seconds away from each other. god bless america. took amtrak from penn to mystic, got here just before 10, slept all day, had dinner with mom and dad, drove into town, saw justyn at the  urlLink bookstore , got an iced coffee (god bless american) at the green marble, saw some of the downtown kids, went for a couple of drinks after justyn got off work at john's place, which is a sweet divey bar in mystic. she is leaving tomorrow but im glad i got to see her. there seems to be nobody around, so it's probably gonna be me vs. the townies for the rest of this week. i am so out of it. must sleep.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 18th time. The tested sentence is:  Just realised that this has been going a week now! I didn't think I'd keep it up this long. Maybe it's because I'm away from school right now; I'm updating every day. Hopefully this will continue. Obviously, since I'm off for just over two weeks starting from Thursday, I won't be as regular. But hey, it's a good start! As we are going on holiday on Saturday, to a remote location in Wales, we are going to need food. Other years we have gone food shopping the day before, and taken it all with us. Fortunately, with the wonderous internet, it will become much easier. This year, we are signing on to  urlLink Tesco.com  . For those who do not know, Tesco is a massive food supermarket chain. They offer, on their website, an 'online shop', where one can browse through items you want, add it to a cyber-trolley, and pay for them at an online checkout where you put in your credit card details. In the next few days, a Tesco van will pull up outside your house, and deliver these items  to your door. All you need to do is unpack! Well, it so happens that the cottage we are going to be staying in is in an area where Tesco will deliver. So on our arrival day, we should see a Tesco van sitting outside, with all our food needed for the next few days. You'd have never thought it'd happen!    urlLink Dawn Eden , who I met last week is back from her travels. Go check out her blog at  urlLink www.dawneden.com/blogger.html   Right, thats all from me. G'night. urlLink The Last Alliance . This is the name of the site of which I am a member. This is its description of itself:   "The Last Alliance is an online resource centre and meeting point for players of Games Workshop's Lord of the Rings battle game. Run by gamers for gamers, it is our mission to make it easier than ever for the community to share their knowledge, experience and tips with other players. "   Yes, I play those 'Warhammer' games. Though technically,   urlLink Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game s  is nothing like Warhammer. The gameplay itself is based upon the Warhammer gameplay, but everything else is different. For those that have no idea of what I'm going on about, this is a brief overview. You buy little models, metal and plastic, about an inch high, paint them and then, using various rules, you battle with them.  I started playing it when a magazine called  urlLink Battle Games in Middle Earth  came out. This is the same models/game as the  urlLink GamesWorkshop  one, but just made it available to a wider area of the population.  I now have over 200 miniatures, and have spent around 200-250 pounds. Take a look at the various links to see what they are like.  When my site is done, I will have my own pictures on it.  This is just one that I have painted:   It is a facinating hobby, but one that is looked upon as geekish and pathetic by popular people. You get a whole lot of flak if you don't do what 'normal' people do, but you learn to live with it. It's one of my sister's 21st birthday tomorrow, and as she is having a proper celebration with her friends some time in September, she just wanted to do something nice with the family today. So, after church, we drove all the way to  urlLink Easton Lodge Gardens . As we live in Luton, Easton Lodge Gardens (ELG) aren't that far away. But with the heat, and the long winding country roads, it seemed much longer.  Anyway, as our family quite often goes to visit old country homes, stately gardens etc, I wasn't to happy to be going. Luckily, ELG were very different from other gardens I've seen. It was, until quite recently, neglected, and had fallen into ruin - if gardens can do that.  So the gardens are quite wild and rugged, but have an inherent neatness. The day was really, really hot, but still nice. We had a picnic under a massive cedar tree with a long swing coming down. After that we just wandered through the gardens, and eventually settled down by a long glade. Thereupon most of the family lay down, and stayed in that position until it was time to go.  As we approached Luton, it started to rain. Two quotes from Winston Churchill:    Lady Nancy Astor:    Winston, if you were my husband, I'd put arsenic in your morning coffee.       Churchill:    Madam, if you were my wife, I'd drink it.     and    Bessie Braddock:    Winston, you are drunk!       Churchill:    And Madam, you are ugly. And tomorrow, I'll be sober, and you will still be ugly.      urlLink Bessie Braddock  was a Liverpool MP during the Second World War.   It was hot again today. I just stayed inside most of the time and read  urlLink 'Sharpes Waterloo '. It's an excellent book, one of Bernard Cornwall's better Sharpe novels, I think. I'm also reading Geoffrey Ashe's 'Mythology of the British Isles' that I got yesterday. Facinating stuff. Wow, what a day! Up at the crack of dawn - well, 7.00 - and to the Chiltern Hotel to get onto the coach. I was expecting a journey of about 2 1/2 hours, tops. Turns out it was about 4! Luckily, we had a toilet break at a place called  urlLink Lacock . This village is home to  urlLink Lacock Abbey , the location for parts of  urlLink 'Pride & Prejudice'  and the Harry Potter films.   urlLink     A rather bright view of the Abbey   urlLink     Part of Lacock Village itself   urlLink     Some historic building in Lacock! It just looked nice.  Then we eventually got to Galstonbury. After parking to coach, we made our way to The Shrine of Our Lady of Glastonbury.  urlLink     Upstairs in the Church hall, we had 'elevenses' at 12.30 (Somerset cream tea!), and met up with Geoffrey Ashe and his wife.  urlLink    The man is  urlLink Dale Ahlquist , President of the Chesterton Society in the US. He was the one who brought over all the Americans of the Chesterton Pilgrimage. The woman in white standing next to him is Geoffrey's wife.   urlLink     Geoffrey talking to the Monseigneur.   urlLink     Geoffrey talking in the Shrine.  After the talk, Geoffrey took us round the grounds of the Abbey at Glastonbury.  urlLink     This is the approach to the Abbey, with the tower coming over the roofs.   urlLink     Part of the remains of the Abbey - it was torn down with the dissolution of the monastaries in the Reformation.   urlLink    This is the archway seen in the last photo. One of the decorative arches - about the third one out from the middle - tells the story of the first few chapters from St. Matthews Gospel.   urlLink    Standing by King Arthur's alleged, but unmarked  grave .  urlLink    The actual ground. His body, found here under a lead cross was then exhumed by monks, and placed in a tomb by the High Altar.   urlLink    Part of Dale Ahlquist's family and Geoffrey Ashe plus wife.   urlLink     King Arthur's  tomb . The sign reads:  "In the Year 1101, the bodies of King Arthur and his Queen were said to have been found on the South Side of the Lady Chapel. On 10th April 1278, their remains were removed in the presence of King Edward I and Queen Eleanor to a black marble tomb on this site. This tomb survived until the dissolution of the Abbey in 1539."    urlLink     Another shot.   urlLink     Legend has it that Joseph of Arametheia planted his staff at Glastonbury, and it grew into a thorn bush. The strange thing about this thornbush, is that it is only native to the Holy Land. Geoffrey and his wife standing under it. This is not the orignal bush - the original is on a hilltop nearby.  After the tour of the Abbey, a group of us decided to walk up to the  urlLink Tor .  urlLink     This is it from the streets below. We had about an hour to climb it and get back to the coach, so we walked as fast as we could. The hill is over 500ft tall, but the climb was worth it, as the views were amazing.   urlLink    By this time, I only had one small photo left, so I took a picture of one of the stunning views. We could see for miles! We raced back down into Glastonbury, and just before we got onto the coach to go back home, I raced into the bookshop, and bought Geoffrey Ashe's book  urlLink 'Mythology of the British Isles' . I then raced back outside, went over to him, and got it signed! The message inside reads "Best wishes Geoffrey Ashe Aug/04". Heh.  He hasn't seen the film of King Arthur yet, so I couldn't ask him about it.  The journey home wasn't too bad, but again, I'm really tired. Luckily the weather held out! The weather today was mixed. For the most part, it was very dry; almost humid. Apparently there was meant to be another thunderstorm today, but all we saw of that was some sporadic rain, and even that was only a little.  Anyway, enough of the weather. Go see  urlLink 'King Arthur' ! Went to see it today, and I promise you, you wont be disappointed. Forget what the critics say, unless they say good things about it of course. Apart from the occasional below-par acting (the young Lancelot for instance), it was a gripping film. Moving, even, in some parts. It's not comparable with either  urlLink 'Lord of the Rings' , or  urlLink 'Troy' , because of the completely different situations, but it was as good as them. It portrayed almost-post-Roman Britain very well, and there were some fantastic scenery shots. Just go see it!  I am in Glastonbury tomorrow. No, not for the music festival, that finished ages ago, but to listen to  urlLink Geoffrey Ashe  speak. In fact, I will be doing much more. I am going with a group of Americans to visit the  urlLink Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Glastonbury . Then there will be a talk by Geoffrey Ashe, one of the world's greatest authorities on King Arthur and Arthurian legend. After a 'light picnic', there will be a tour of  urlLink Glastonbury Abbey  with Geoffrey. I will return in the evening. It will be interesting to see what, if indeed he does, Geoffrey Ashe says about the film 'King Arthur', and whether it is a 'true' portrayal or not. Our town council has decided that our street was too dirty. So last week they sent letters out to every household explaining what was going to be happening. As they were going to be clearing the drains as well, we were asked to move all the cars off the street. So I woke up this morning to see a street completely empty of cars - a sight which probably hasn't been seen since 1930's maybe. Anyway, they're done now, but I don't see any difference. I havn't actually been down to the street yet, so there may be some things I didn't see. It will be interesting to see how long the street takes to become dirty again. English weather is cruel. This is a known fact. The day before yesterday was as lovely weather as you could hope for; bright blue skies, a warm wind etcetc. Now yesterday was a completely different matter - such torrential rain that to stand underneath it was like being pummelled with, uhm, things that pummell you. I was walking back from the library, and as I had no money to phone home, nor a mobile, I had to run through the town wearing my jeans and a t-shirt. By the time I had got home, I was saturated. Absolutely soaking. Today, of course, to stop us English from getting too comfortable with the weather, it has decided to revert to it's sunny state, and is looking very pleasant. No doubt tomorrow it will start snowing, or some such equally silly weather for the beginning of August.   I will be going to see  urlLink 'King Arthur'  tomorrow. Apparently it's not that good, but since I've seen Lord of the Rings, and Troy, I want to see the next sword-y film. More on that when I come back.  Saw  urlLink Minority Report  again yesterday at my girlfriend's house. Slightly unnerving film, as it is set pretty close in the future. I have a few friends who have a blog, but it was only after meeting  urlLink Dawn Eden  yesterday that I decided to do one of my own. Here goes...

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 19th time. The tested sentence is:  .....cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry.   Five days since you laughed at me saying    get that together come back and see me.   Three days since the living room   I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you   Yesterday you'd forgiven me   but it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry     Yes! As the Barenaked Ladies song says, it's been 1 week. 1 long week in BC. It has gone flying by as I have been having so much fun! It has been an action packed week with tonnes of stuff to do! I ate Sushi for the first time, saw my first   CFL   game (GO BC!), played golf for the first time in 2 years, enjoyed take outs from   Boston Pizza   and   Dominos  ! U name it I did it!  Today we went to downtown Vancouver to visit the   Much Music Xbox Unleashed tour   and the   Yaletown Summer Celebration  . So we had trouble finding   City TV   (where   Unleashed   was) as  urlLink   Multimap.com    gave us really crap directions. When we finally found it, it was soooo crap we left after 5 minutes! All the   Xbox   games had been out for ages! So we left and went to Yaletown. It was really cool - so many classic cars and stalls! It was really fun to walk around!  We went to visit one of Dad's old employees Stefan, who manages the   Blue Water Cafe   in Yaletown. The restaurant is one of the most trendy and best places to eat in Vancouver, so when Uncle Nigel said we could go to the Sushi bar there, I was amazed! We had a Sushi platter which was so delicious, soooo much better than the takeaway. We sat at the bar where it was made and saw them prepare it. The Head Sushi Chef is one of the best in BC.   I bought some postcards (coming to a mailbox near you, soon! [I hope!]) to send and then went to   7-Eleven   to try their famous   Slurpee  ! It was really nice. I had   Pepsi   flavour. They're a bit like   Slush Puppies   or   Ice Blasts   in the UK but sooo much nicer!  Well after an eventful week, I'm amazed I still have money left! So BRING ON THE SPENDING! So I'm just back from watching    BC Lions    take on   Ottawa Renegades   in Canadian Football. The Atmosphere was absolutely amazing! Although they say the NFL is better than the CFL, I still truely enjoyed myself.  We left home at around 3pm and drove to Surrey to get the   SkyTrain   into Stadium station - where BC Place Stadium is - The Home Of The    BC Lions .   In itself, the   SkyTrain   is really cool, a bit like the   Docklands Light Railway   in London.  When we arrived the thing they called the "Street Party" more like the corner party (ha!) was getting underway. SO we walked around the shops for a bit and then came back for the party. I got to try a corn dog - which was relatively nice! - and got some free stuff.   The Beat 94.5   gave me some stickers, a lemon ice tea (nice!) and free months membership to a gym! Shame it ain't valid in England! I was also given a Subway football by DJ Big D which was cool. We made our way in and donated some canned food so I could have my photo taken with the Grey Cup - it is really big and cool! Just strolled around the concourse of the stadium and Uncle Nigel got me a free T-Shirt by signing up to a credit card! lol! I also got a programme and a    BC Lions    flag! Then we took our seats. They were really good - Row E seats 105 & 106! Really close to the bench.  The game commenced with the    Lions    coming out of a helmet with fireworks which was really dramatic! GO BC! GO BC! The    Felions Dance Squad    came out aswell, to a chorus of big cheers. They were hot! Lol! :P The Game kicked off and    BC    scored a touchdown early on. The match was even until the end of the 3rd quarter when    BC    dominated. There were some amazing runs and plays in the game and some really dodgy decisions by the refs! What do I expect - it's sports! In the end the Final Score was    BC Lions  47 - 27 Ottawa Renegades  ! GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!      The atmosphere is sooooo different from an English soccer game down at The Valley, slightly lower attendence tonight of 25,000 but sooo different! Whenever a player got into the endzone a huge cheer broke, also if they made a good run, another broke. They had these mini games take place between games where prizes were won -   Save On Foods   Kick To Win, Catch to Win,   Air Canada   Flight Path,   Tim Hortons   Coffee Race, Go Kart Race etc! The cheerleaders often came on to dance on the pitch. Also   Subway   were firing the footballs into the crowd - but I already had mine! A car drove around throwing stuff out occasionally. The bench was so close to us too! I saw a player get really stressed and smash up the water dispensers on the table! Lots of Mexican Waves happened and there was a crowd cheer metre up on the screen that went up when people screamed - bulls**t I know but its fun! I found myself to get more into the game as it went on!  There were big screens around showing people in the crowd, and also   TSN   (sports channel) were broadcasting. I saw Uncle Nigel and I up on the screen a couple of times, and also the   TSN   camera filmed us! I know I was on Canada TV as the camera light was flashing red! I'm Famous Man! I'm Famous in Canada! OH MY GOD!  Came back home and had a pizza from   Boston Pizza   - delicious - Uncle Nigel was giving the gal in the shop hassle cos she didn't know what she was doing, bless her. She was really sweet! She also liked my hat! Come to think of it all of the Canadian women are sweet to me, maybe just cos I'm English, or maybe its because of my good looks! EH! Haha P.I.M.P  At least I watched my first CFL game with a win. So theres 1 thing left to say - GO BC! GO BC! GO BC! So I'm really having fun in BC! I have watched to wicked movies -   The Rundown   (  Welcome To The Jungle   in the UK) and   The Big Bounce   both if which were so funny! I have been shopping, bought my Sister's   iPod   and 12 packs of   Juicy Fruit.   I am loving all of the shops around here! I also got my   fido   sim card so I can make cheap calls.  So I've been listening to Mercury FM and Capital FM - sad I know but I can't get a radio station with all of the music I like on. The Beat and Z 95.3 are good, but I need UK music!! Hahaha. I'm listening to Mercury as I speak!  I'm off to shoot some golf balls at the Driving Range shortly. Tomorrow I'm off to the BC Lions vs Ottawa Renegades match at the BC Place Stadium, Vancouver - I'm really looking forward to that! There is a street party before which looks fun.  On Saturday, I'm hopefully going to the Much Music Xbox Unleashed show at City TV, Vancouver - this looks like I'm gonna see all of the latest games revealed! Also I'm going to the Yaletown festival which should be fun!  OMG I'm a criminal - I stood with 1 foot in USA and the other in Canada yesterday! hahaha! So I'm here in Canada and I have decided to start a blog! Im in Langley, BC having a great time.  The FLight over with Air Transat was pretty rubbish but at least I had a nice girl called Brittni and her Mum Leona to chat to! Thank god as I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooo bored!  I played golf on my first day, Sunday, which I was crap at lol!!! The on monday I visited the Ski Resort of Whistler which was sooooooooooooo pretty! The views at the top of whistler mountain were so beautiful! I have some good pictures!  The shops in Canada are sooooo cool! I love all of the huge shops here - like  Golf Town  where you can get all of the golfing attire you need. Also I think  Radio Shack  is quite cool too and I bought one of their mini remote control ZipZap cars! Its pretty cool!! I also bought my Canadian Sim Card for my Mobile(Cell - man I've gotta talk Canadian!) Phone.  As Mc Donalds would say - BC I'm Lovin It  BTW The Time of this post is PT not GMT So this is my last post from BC Canada! I've had such a great time, but I am really looking 4ward to seeing everyone again! I'm not looking forward to the Air TransCRAP flight, but there ya go!  Weather has been good today! Bit overcast nowI went to Wal Mart and bought a pencil case and ruler for school! Cost me Â£1.50 so I was pleased!  Packed my suitcase, everything fits (thank God!). I came to work out the tax that I can claim back. THE STUPID CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ONLY ALLOWS TAX BACK ON PURCHASES OF $50 OR MORE. So I had Olivia's iPod and the fishing license recipts and thats it - $26.54 of tax - Â£8 roughly! Cheapskates!  So I'm off now to have the Salmon I caught on Thursday, BBQ Stylee!  **L8RS** OH CANADA! So, Uncle Nigel got a wasp sting and had to be taken into hospital this Friday as he had an allergic reaction to it. So, Aunt Linda took me home and said to order Pizza. I came to order the pizza so I tried my favourite Boston Pizza! I spoke to the girl who served us the other night, she remembered me as when she asked for telephone number I said I was visiting from England! 'I think you were in the other night and you ordered pizza and bread and I mucked the order up?!' Yeah, Hi, nice pizza though! 'Hey'. So when I told her the telephone number, she didnt understand when I said "double 3". 'It must be an English thing!" she said. I just think it's because she was thick! So I ordered the pizza, for an individual, and then she tells me I have to have a minimum order of $17.99. As it was individual it was only $9.25. Gawd! So I thanked her and said it was only me who was eating!  I rang Pizza Hut, whose minimum was $10.00, but individual pizzas cost $3.95! Argghhh! So I ended up ordering a medium 'Canada, Eh?' pizza. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner for the next 3 days then lol! I'm just back from a day in Vancouver and I am absolutely knackered!  I got the SkyTrain into town after UN dropped me off - he played golf today! I got off at Stadium and went to the BC Lions offices as a guy (I think his name was Bill) had arranged to get me BC Lions & Felions posters. He brought them through and I shook his hand. He had got the Felions poster signed by Leah - a cheerleader - and gave me a Hall Of Fame BC Lions player autograph as well! That was so cool!  Walked up Robson after that and then had a Subway for lunch which was delicious! I went to Blue Water Cafe in Yaletown and had a drink with Stefan - very pleasant! He asked about Dad and told me what it was like living in Vancouver. After this I got back on the SkyTrain to Waterfront and then got on the SeaBus to Lonsdale Quay - this is well cool as it is a ferry that takes you over the water included in the travel pass!!!! Took some photos of Vancouver from there.  Then I got back on the train to Metrotown - a huge shopping district! I got a Roots bag for school, really nice and only $34.00 (13 quid!) and a Roots Canada T-Shirt. Roots is a leading brand name in Canada!  I eventually made it back to King George to meet UN. I was SO tired! AL and I had Boston Pizza when we got back - sooooo nice! :D  On Monday we went Whale Watchin which was so cool! We were really close to the Whales and it was really fun!  Tuesday golfed again with next door neighbour Pat and his son Jordan. they beat us by +1 but I had improved, especially my putting! GO BC! GO BC! GO BC!

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 20th time. The tested sentence is:  Round 'n round     Carousel     Has got you under it's spell     Moving so fast...but     Going nowhere          Up 'n down     Ferris wheel     Tell me how does it feel     To be so high...     Looking down here          Carnival Town     Norah Jones         For the second time now, i've been able to see Norah Jones in concert.  Mmmmmmm.  Nothing is wrong in the world anymore.  It's just SO relaxing.  Granted the soft blue lighting and mood music didn't hurt.  She's amazing.  i told Kristy that if anything ever fell through between her and i, Norah is the next person down my list.        And from that concert here's a joke from Mr. Adam Levy, guitarist. Ahem . . . .      Knock, knock    who's there?    Pile Up    Pile Up Who?    HA HA, you just said PILE OF POOH!      So many highlights, so little time.  Also, if you get some time, check out this new guy, Amos Lee.  Very cool.  He opened last night - great acoustic, folky, relaxing sound.      Peace All. Today, Kristy is 24 years old!  Happy Birthday!  i love you very much!  You can probably figure that out by my over-use of exclamation points.       i also filled out an appliacation for a new apartment, real close to work, real nice, real home-ish.  Coffey Creek - figured it had to be a sign.  Now if i could only get my hands on some $$$$?      Life is good.      i've been reading a lot of the Psalms lately and i've realized that at least i'm not the only one who has high and low points in my faith.  David would write about how GOD has been protecting him and slaying his enemies one minute, and later, he would be asking GOD how long he would be forgotten?  What is that?      i mean . . . i do the same thing, don't get me wrong.  i blame GOD all the time for things that i have to take responsibility for.  it's just nice to know that i'm not the first one . . . and that I can learn too.      Grace to y'all. So, yesterday, i had my first hair cut, in about 3 years, i figure.  Two with my head shaved, and just about one year of growth.  It cost as much to cut my hair ONCE as it did to buy my clippers.  Weird.    i also get to drive to Greenville, SC today to meet Marty Mikles to pick up my bass and other items.  That's not so bad.  i miss my bass, it'll be good to get it back.    i'm in and out of the office - it will be nice to be one or the other. It will also be nice to have a place to live.  I have a lot of prayer requests . . .       Maybe i'll go pray. i'm as close to home as i can be.  Today i test drove my first official Tim Horton's Coffee Brewer.  Mmmmm.  Sweet Tim Horton's . . . takes away the pain.    So does Jesus.  This is what He gave me today: "I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry.  He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire, he set my feet on a rock, and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of  praise to our God.  Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord." Psalm 40:1-3    i prayed that prayer today. It's my story. Well . . . after 17-ish days in Oklahoma, i'm finally back in North Carolina.  It's nice.  Granted, i did have a great time playing my bass ALL DAY EVERY DAY for SEVEN DAYS!  i don't really have a home at this point . . . so that's a little annoying and/or bothersome.  The rest of my life is pretty  much still up in the air.  In any case, i'm sure that GOD has got it all figured out already.  So, no worries.     A few interesting trivial facts that i've learned today.  On my flight, i sat next to a pilot for a frieght company today.  He was just getting back from Tokyo.  Turns out, your cell phone doesn't interfere with on-board electronics on airplanes at all . . . that's just what they tell you so you'll turn them off.  He also said that flying is much like driving in that he is often a back-seat pilot.  Interesting.    i got to see Kristy today - she made spaghetti for dinner.  Mmmmm.  And now i'm watching Whose Line is it Anyway? AND they're playing Scenes from a Hat!  All after having an amazing week with GOD . . . it doesn't get any better.     Also, singing and praying in an airport can be a very interesting experience . . . especially with 25 young people who are on fire for Jesus.  People get 'interested' when stuff like that happens.  Now we just have to pray to stay in this state of mind . . . state of heart, i guess.      There's a lot riding on us staying pumped.  Oh that we would FINALLY not live from conference to conference, but that we could internalized all of the things that we've learned and be better examples of Jesus!    i'll keep you posted. There is something altogether liberating about committing (with 300 of your closest friends) to raising over $150,000 to help knock out poverty, help other marginalia populations, and worship . . . . All at the same time. I had no idea that for $3,000 USDA, The Salvation Army can build and run a children's home. $3,000 . . . that's it. Especially here in the Southern US, $3,000 is petty cash.       TYI in Oklahoma finishes today . . . tomorrow i travel back to Charlotte. For the first time in a LONG time, i'm  excited  about going there. But it also means a return to the real world . . . a world that doesn't put the same value on my re-found extremism. i need people to help me keep everything in focus.      And to think, just a few weeks ago, it was still up in the air as to whether or not i was going to be 'allowed' to come. Thank you GOD for working that out!      See you back in NC! Incidentally, if you want to give money to help me build a Children's home for some hurting kids, that would be awesome.      Grace! Why is it that i have to come to Oklahoma to learn how desensitized i've become. Continuing an amazing week of God ripping through the walls that i've put up over the past two years, today we talked about Ezekiel 8 and 9. Read it - but be careful, beecause it's pretty prophetic so it may not be real EASY reading.    "Lemme explain . . . no, no . . . there is too much. Let me sum up."       GOD takes Ezekiel and gives him a whirlwind tour of the temple, and shows him all of the crap that people are doing there. None of GODs people seemed to care that: a) people were hurting and, b) that GOD was hurting.       Danielle used this reference to jump into talking about injustice in the world and how we don't care that millions of children die unnessecarily every day, that people are craving drugs more than life, and that GOD's heart is breaking. Why don't i care?     And i've always been pretty soft. i'm the little school girl hidden inside a grown mans body. And that started when i was four years old, when i saw Disney's  Pete's Dragon  for the first time, and left the Avalon Mall, in St. John's crying to break my heart that the Dragon had to fly away.     Today i wept because there are a lot of hurting people that i haven't cared about.         my favorite thought of the day: knowing GOD's mind just means you can know religion; knowing GOD's heart is something competely different. Anything we do has to come out of our connection with GOD's heart. i can't bring food to a homeless man to show off my super-pressed, ultra-pasteurized new uniform. i need to bring him food because GOD's heart breaks that there is a hungry man. It's ok to be emotional - GOD is emotional: he both created them and experiences them himself.     Alright - so i won't keep every post as deep as they've been . . . maybe. At least i'll take every opportunity to write other stuff too. It's just been a very deep week for me. In fact, it's probably best if i don't make ANY promises about this stuff. i've just been reminded of my past; of who i used to be. Now i realize i need to go back and, for all intents and purposes, pick up from late 2001. Frankly, i've lost my passion, i've lost focus on what i need to be. i'm a Christian who has chosen to live my Christianity as a soldier of The Salvation Army.     i've developed a lot of frustration which has turned to apathy and complacency. i've been so annoyed with what i've seen at our churches that i have become overwhelmed. there was just too much for me to change.    GOD is really doing a lot of work on me this week. HE is dragging me back to where i need to be, to pick up from where i left off. i am a solider. i am the salvation army. What i have complained about, i'm realizing that i am. i am the army. The choice is mine to sit back and complain or rise up and fight. As of this week, i've chosen to fight!    i'm sick of complacency. i'm sick of apathy. i'm angry that i am not more in love with JESUS. My week here has marked a new beginning, a spiritual rebirth in my life. That's an amazing thought to me. Praise GOD! i've always considered myself to be pretty smart, even intelligent. "But believing doesn't make it so!" You say. i agree. Often (much MORe often than not, lately), GOD smacks me in the face with a new understanding of a very old truth that i've misunderstood or ignored or rejected.     i'll back-pedal. Right now, i find myself at Camp Heart O' Hills, in Oklahoma. It's a camp that is run by The Salvation Army where there have engathered somewhere near 300 people for Territorial Youth Institute. It's basically a big youth conference for Salvationists (christians who are salvation army soldiers) all over the south-eastern US. Stephen Court and Danielle Strickland (  urlLink  www.armybarmy.com   ) are the guests for the week. In worship yesterday, they introduced the concept of 'Praying the Bible'. As you've probably guessed, to pray the bible is essentially saying the words of the bible in prayer to GOD.      For Example: Psalm 91 - "He who dwells in the shadow of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. i will say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge and my fortress, my GOD in whom i trust.'" Collectively we prayed this prayer. Incidentally, this also happened to be the passage that GOD used to break me into pieces today. Without eating up this post with my history, just know that i have tried to find 'refuge' in some other places before GOD. i've just felt bombarded with stuff that i don't need and haven't really asked GOD for protection. Until today. Today, as i wept, i understood what it meant to have GOD be my refuge.  The passage goes on to say that "If you make the Most High your dwelling . . . then no harm will befall you. You will tread upon the lion and the cobra." (Verses 9 & 13). Why don't we just go to HIM? First? He promised me protection for as long as i've been old enough to read the bible! The 'lions' and 'cobras' that have hunted me down like prey, i can stomp under my feet if i make the Most High my dwelling (i.e. If i trust HIM, i won't be consumed with evil!).  Thanks God for helping me understand you a little more today.  It's been a good day. i can't wait to see the whole picture that GOD has been painting. Perhaps then it will all make sense.  There is still so much in my life that i need to clean out; there is so much thought that i really have to re-evaluate. i've realized today how bitter i have become at my church rather than taken ownership of it and trying to make an impact from the inside out. i've realized how much that GOD wants to use us, but how easily we get tangled up in satan's lies and distractions.  GOD continues to amaze me. Even when i've not been able to make much sense out of my relationship with HIM, HE at least has been a real friend.  There's so much that i want to say . . . i mean, type. But no one even knows about my BLOG yet? i'll have much more to come i'm sure.  "Because he loves me," Says the Lord, "I will rescue Him." It's time to catch up, i figure.  This seems like something that i would have done long before now. i have too many thoughts that seem to get lost.  i usually write them down on real paper, but that gets lost too, so i figure I may as well let you read them too.      So you get in on my life starting today.        Congratulations.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 21th time. The tested sentence is:  I was late getting to the office this morning because  urlLink Arthur  smells too good. Itâ€™s the same reason I was late yesterday and the day before. Arthur needs to keep his good smells to himself in the morning. In particular, his back which always smells like baking cookies. But only in the morning. And only his back. What a lucky combination of sleep smells to wake up smelling like cookies. Also, heâ€™s very warm. That, mixed with the smell of clean sheets is exactly what I need to fall back to sleep after the alarm goes off.  Thatâ€™s why I married him. But, if Iâ€™m going to get up in time for work, Iâ€™ve got to start feeding him garlic the night before. Watching  urlLink this feature  on CBC last night about how Tibetan Buddists aare generally happier, calmer, and less stressed than most people in the Western World got me on to my traditional rant, which I will share with you. It is this: we in Western society do not lead meaningful lives. We have more than everything we need, and weâ€™re just not happy.  Basically my argument is that weâ€™ve completed 1 to 4 in  urlLink Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs , but instead of pursuing self-actualization, weâ€™ve embraced consumerism. Itâ€™s all we have left, if you believe the media. The Western world has long focused itâ€™s attention on material gain, but for much of it, we had religion, which at least gave us some sense of our place in the world. In recent times, many of us have shrugged off the confines of religious belief, and this has left something of a gaping whole in our understanding of ourselves, out priorities, and the world around us.  Now, weâ€™ve become obsessed with the acquisition of material goods as a way of filling that void. Itâ€™s become ridiculous. We work outrageously stressful jobs so that we can make money so that we can acquire more â€œthingsâ€? that we are told will make us happy. Of course, they donâ€™t. So, we work even harder so we can buy better â€œthingsâ€? only to find that those donâ€™t really make us happier either. We consume and consume and are completely defined by our work. Whatâ€™s one of the first things you ask someone when you meet them? â€œSo, what do you do?â€? I mean, itâ€™s even one of the main profile questions in Blogger, for Christ sake! Go to other parts of the world where people arenâ€™t as stressed, and no one asks you â€œwhat do you do?â€? Itâ€™s immaterial.  Now, everyoneâ€™s on Prozac or Ritalin or Valium to control depression, anxiousness, malaise, etc. You just donâ€™t see a lot of Buddhist monks on Prozac. Why? Because they know whatâ€™s important. And having the latest PDA, Audi, or trip to Mexico just isnâ€™t it. Iâ€™m not saying we should all quit our jobs or go back to believing in a God that, quite frankly is as plausible as Santa Claus. Iâ€™m saying the Buddhists have it right. We need to become more introspective, more aware of the â€œrealâ€? world around us, more self-aware, more kind, more tolerant of others, and most importantly, more willing to create meaningful contact with other human beings.  How often have you walked down the street and avoided making eye contact with someone walking 2 feet away from you? How weird is that? Itâ€™s part of our whole culture of isolating ourselves and our stuff from each other. We interact at superficial levels now â€“ customer service calls, PTA meetings, speed dating, mass seminars. Real human interaction has come to a standstill. Ironically, through the anonymity of the Internet, many of us (myself included) are reaching out and making â€œrealâ€? contact with complete strangers while foregoing the intimacy of actual human contact. These are strange times weâ€™re living in. Pass me the Prozac. I don't normally post jokes, and certainly not ones about someone else's countrymen. But, I thought this one was pretty good. It's from my Mom. Thanks, Mom!    The last 4 ex-U.S. Presidents are caught in a tornado, and off they whirl to OZ.           They finally make it to the Emerald City and came before the Great Wizard. "WHAT BRINGS YOU BEFORE THE GREAT WIZARD OF OZ?"           Jimmy Carter steps forward timidly:" I've come for some courage."           "NO PROBLEM!" says the Wizard. "WHO IS NEXT?"           Reagan steps forward, "Well........., I.......I think I need a brain."           "DONE" says the Wizard. "WHO COMES NEXT BEFORE THE GREAT AND POWERFUL OZ?"           Up steps George Bush Sr., sadly, "I'm told by the American people that I need a heart."           "I'VE HEARD IT'S TRUE!" says the Wizard. "CONSIDER IT DONE."

"Is Dorothy here?" Heh Heh. Some guy in the line at  urlLink Tim Horton's  asked me if I was a nurse today. He thought I looked familiar. I thought it was some kind of strange pickup and gave him the shrug off.  It's only several hours later as I sit here at my desk that I realize he likely works in the same hospital as my older sister (we look disturbingly similar, all three of us). She's not a nurse, she's a pharmacy something-or-other, but it all makes sense now.... I can't help but notice how disgusting my keyboard is right now. Did you know that your keyboard likely has more germs living on it than a public toilet?  urlLink Nice . He arrived late to the party. I'd already been heavily into the punch by then. His skin looked very tan against his white T-shirt. He was fit and beautiful and he knew it. He owned the room.  I was drawn to him immediately. We all were. And when he talked, it was like there wasn't anyone else in the room. He was so sure of himself. He knew who he was, and he didn't care if you liked him (but he knew you would). I melted. I was his. We talked most of the night.  And then he said those magical words. "My girlfriend..." As soon as he said it, he knew he'd blown it. The magic was over. Too bad. The vodka made it easier to recover, thankfully.  Having recognized his blunder, he made a quick exit and I went home alone.  I didn't know it then, but we would meet again. And eventually, against my better judegement, I'd marry him. "Mommy, you look different today. I like your hair up like that," says little Benjy.  "Thank you! I thought I'd dress up today," replies Mom.  "Well, you look different. You look..." Benjy hesitates  "Pretty?" Mommy supplies.  "No, that's not it." she answers. Hereâ€™s something I just dug out of the archives of my brain. It was stored under high school mysteries.  There was this girl, well  woman  now, really, whoâ€™s shadowed me all of my high school dating existence. I donâ€™t know why and probably never will.  We went to the same school from the ages 10 to 19. I wasnâ€™t great friends with her, but we shared some mutual friends, so I hung out with her off and on quite a bit for 10 grades (high school went to Grade 13 in Ontario until 2 years ago). I even visited her in the hospital in the 11th grade when she tried to kill herself. Apparently, she was also bulimic, but not very good at it from what I could tell. Thatâ€™s a different post, though.  Anyway from the time I was 16 until the time I was 19, I dated these fellows:  Elvis (yeah, Iâ€™m not kidding), Anthony (broke my heart), Shane (bastard), Chris1 (geek), Chris2 (nice geek), Todd (sweetie), Jerry (eye candy). I canâ€™t remember if this is totally accurate, but it contains the main gist.  I remember that while I was dating Anthony, having this funny â€œpukeâ€? feeling when I saw her at the local mini-mart and she had â€œTania lovesâ€? on one Converse sneaker toe and â€œElvisâ€? on the other. I mean, how many Elvisâ€™s are there in any anglo town? I thought it was weird that she would date an ex, as my friends didnâ€™t usually do that to each other, but what the hell. She and Elvis became really good friends, from what Iâ€™ve heard. Anyway, she went on to date Chris1 not too long after weâ€™d broken up.  I started to think then that it was a bit weird that sheâ€™d dated two of my exâ€™s, but I didnâ€™t think much of it since I hadnâ€™t dated either of them for very long, nor had I â€œdone itâ€? with them (in retrospect, Iâ€™ve decided that if you canâ€™t say the word â€œsexâ€? out loud, then youâ€™re likely not mature enough to be having it).  She went on to have a serious relationship with Chris2, which I found extraordinarily creepy, as weâ€™d been quite an item. That was at the height of her bulimia. She never went for Todd (who was by then in university), or Anthony (he had transferred to a different high school in Grade 11) but when Jerry and I broke up after the prom, he told me that she tried to seduce him shortly thereafter. He thought it was funny, but it just reaffirmed my paranoia. Apparently she also hooked up with Shane after our romance ended rather surreptitiously for reasons that I can only describe as â€œvery bad.â€? I donâ€™t know if she had the same problems with him that I did, but thatâ€™s a different story.  Anyway, at the time, I had no idea why she would want to date these guys. In retrospect, I think she had a lot of self-esteem issues and these guys were all readily available and recently rejected. They were all from our high school, and I had broken up with them all rather spinelessly and without thought for their feelings. I always wondered if she nursed their wounds and commiserated with them on what a nasty bitch I was. I used to think that I was just being paranoid and arrogant, but now Iâ€™m not so sure.  Sometimes I think about that whole thing and wonder if I should get her number from the last remaining high school friend that I still semi-contact and give her a call to find out what the hell all of that was about. But, then I think that itâ€™s not important enough to worry about. And it isnâ€™t. It just makes me shake my head a bit and smile. I'm also really glad that Arthur and I never dated in high school. Update on the kitten front for those who aren't sick to death of hearing about it. Sweetie loves the brushing. So does Zoro, but he's not so obvious about it.  Zoro either hides in the corner, or in his carrier. He doesn't run away when I brush him, though, and his quiet little motor turns on. As soon as Zoro starts purring, then Sweetie purrs for no reason and pushes his head against my hand. He wears his heart on his sleeve, that one does. It's very cute.  By the end of this week, I think we can consider them family members. :) For those of you who have seen the  urlLink Marineland  commercials, don't believe them. They are marketing geniuses. Basically, everything you see on the commercials is all that there is. It hasn't changed much since I went there when I was 12 (that's 21 years ago, for those counting).  They pimp out their animals to the guests. You can buy food and  urlLink feed  bears, deer,  urlLink killer whales  (I'm not kidding), and  urlLink Beluga whales . There must be twenty bears in their exhibit, and they're all begging for food. It's really sad.  The rides need some work. You know a ride is not good when your 4-year old tells you "that was lame." But the SkyScreamer was very good, and almost worth the 2 1/2 hour drive to Niagara Falls. Arthur wouldn't take us to actually see the Falls, though. Pity. Frankie and Benjy haven't seen them. Maybe next time.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 23th time. The tested sentence is:  Alcohol in the human body:   Ethanol, or more commonly known as alcohol, is found in a variety of popular beverages (bear, wine & spirits). It is one of the most used (and abused) drugs in our society. It is produced by the fermentation of fruits, vegetables, or grains by yeast which converts the carbohydrates into ethyl alcohol or ethanol. Alcohol can be taken up by any body surface, but is most efficiently taken up as it is usually consumed; after drinking an alcoholic beverage. When it enters the body, ethanol is absorbed over almost the entire length of the digestive tract. About 90% of ethanol consumed is absorbed into the blood stream, irrespective of the presence of food (food only slows the process down). Ethanol is then carried all over the body, particularly places, like the brain and the liver, which are highly perfused with blood. In the liver, ethanol is broken down by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase into acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a poison which is the main cause of the harmful effects of alcohol consumption. Acetaldehyde is then converted into acetate by an enzyme called acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetate is a harmless compound, used to create energy. It is estimated that the total amount of ethanol broken down per hour is in the range of 0.1-0.3 grams per kilogram body weight per hour. These fundamental processes are common to all human beings and sufficient to break down moderate quantities of alcohol. However, environmental factors (drinking habits) and genetic factors (activities of the enzymes involved) may affect the rate of alcohol metabolism. An example of this would be with about 40% of Asians, whose acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme is inactive, meaning they have higher levels of acetaldehyde in the blood upon alcohol consumption, causing facial flushing, cardiac arrhythmia, headache and vomiting. When more alcohol than the mentioned above enzymes can break down is consumed, other enzymes will help with the break down of ethanol. The activity of these enzymes contributes to the toxicity and possibly carcinogenicity in alcoholics. Hardly any alcohol is excreted with urine, breath and tears, which means that practically all of it is broken down. 90-98% of consumed alcohol is broken down, 1-5% is excreted via the lungs and 1-3% is excreted via the other routes such as urine (0.5-2.0%) and sweat (up to 0.5%).  Alcohol depresses parts of the central nervous system, slowing down some of our brain functions. Various parts of the central nervous system are depressed by alcohol, with all sorts of consequences. For example, when the brain's speech centres are inhibited, this causes slurred speech; when the vision centres are affected this produces distorted vision; when the co-ordination centres are depressed this results in loss of balance and limb control. The strong depressant effect of alcohol lasts for a few hours after drinking, but alcohol also produces a weaker agitation (or irritation) of the nervous system that lasts much longer. This is the cause of the hangover and shakiness. It's due to the irritation of the nervous system by alcohol drunk many hours before. This effect often leads heavy evening drinkers to drink again the next morning, as the agitation can be temporarily overcome by drinking more alcohol. Thus, a vicious circle is set in motion, which can play a large part in alcoholic drinking patterns. Trepanation   Trepanation is the drilling of a hole in the head. It is one of the oldest surgical practices and is still practiced religiously in some African tribes. When done properly, it will give the person to whom it was done to, a permanent 'high'. If your normal self is '0' and LSD is '100', a good dose of hash is lets say '50', then trepanation is about '30' (approximately 2 pints of lager); a nice feeling. Twenty minute orgasm   The male pig is the mammal with the longest orgasm. When mating he will ejaculate a whopping half a pint of sperm. Then to make sure it doesn't just poor out of the female pig, he will ejaculate a sticky substance which blocks the hole. His penis is a cork screw shape (long, thin & curly). His orgasm lasts 20 minutes... There are two types of people. There are those who eat to live and there are those who live to eat. i like to think i'm of the second group. Tips on keeping sober:   -Drink one glass of milk before drinking alcohol. It lines the stomach and slows down the intake of alcohol into the blood stream. Remember, drinking it afterwards will have no effect. -Have a good meal before drinking. The food absorbs the alcohol and slows down the diffusion of alcohol into the blood stream. -Keep eating snacks which are offered to you (if they are). Not only does it slow keep up the amount of food in the stomach and small intestine, but it will also slow down the rate at which you drink. -Drink lots of water. For every glass of alcohol you drink, you must drink at least one glass of water. Alcohol decreases the release of ADH, therefore, more water is in the urine, therefore, you will be in the toilet a lot. But this means you must drink lots of water, to compensate for the extra water loss. -Moderate your drinking. Do not drink lots of alcohol in a short space of time, but spread this amount out over a longer period of time. Also you do not need to stick to alcohol; nobody is going to tell you off if you have a soft drink now and again. -Know your limit. If you start to feel as if you are forgetting the laws of gravity, stop drinking and switch to soft drinks or water. -Count your drinks. -Know what you are drinking.  -Keep an eye on your drink. It could be spiked while you are not looking. Term, holidays, term, holidays, till we leave school, and then work, work, work, till we die. Firepower   London has had thousands of devastating fires from the great fire of London in 1666 to the blitz in the Second World War. These have wiped out hundreds of homes and killed many people. But every time this happens, London grows stronger. London was originally built by the Romans, because of its ideal location. It would be near an estuary and almost surrounded by marshland, so it could not be invaded. London was invaded only once, by the Anglo-Saxons, who drove the Romans out. They literally burnt the entire city with those who did not run away in it. Beneath London, there is a reddy colour to the soil. Red is the colour of blood, fire and war. Red is the colour of the Roman buildings which were burned to the ground. Red is the colour of power and victory. Some say that the name â€œLondonâ€? comes from the Celtic: â€œlondusâ€? meaning â€œfierceâ€?. In 1666, the great fire of London wiped out a large part of the centre of London. Wren was the architect who rebuilt most of the replacing buildings, including the new st Paulâ€™s Cathedral. He told one of his workers to go to the site and mark the exact point above which the globe hemisphere would go. This worker found a tombstone in the rubble, which had nothing written on it except for one Latin word at the top which translates to â€œwe will riseâ€?. I think everyday swearing is fucking marvellous. People say they are used when you dont know what to say. But one knows what he is saying and needs to use these words (eg. you fucking arsehole). "You know what I mean?" is said when people dont know what to say. These are 'bad' words. Everyday swearing shoold be used more often. It can be said that you learn through mistakes. I sure hope that's true because I don't want to have blood poring out of my right leg, torn shorts and torn laces (at first, later that day I had 1/4 of the original length of the shoe lace & a shoe which was falling off my foot every now and again). For those who don't want to make this mistake to start with, DON'T DIVE ON CONCRETE, NO-MATTER HOW INTO THE SPORT YOU ARE! UFOs   After having watched a program on TV about UFOs I beleive in them even less. They didn't have any hard data, it was all just people claiming to have seen them. There was one clip where all you could see was the back of the necks of some soldiers and a bright light. When some farmers were interviewed about a 'landing', they all came up with different information. The army came in to dig up whatever was on the metal detector; it was a small chunk of iron, which can be found anywhere. Did NASA con the world?   Did NASA con the world about the landing on the moon? The photos are certainly fakes, with wind, shadows & no stars. So should Armstrong really be famous? Find out next Wednesday at 9pm on C5. I definitely wont miss it. Vote us out of the EU   I caught the last few minutes of the BBC news, where they wanted us to vote ourselves out of the EU. I didn't catch any of the arguments but made a few of my own. I, for a start, am strongly against the euro (partly because I hate frogs), but mostly because I am proud to be British and love the Pound. It is one of the srongest currencies in the world and I think that both the EU and America want Britain to join their currency; because if we did, it would be by far the strongest currency. To be safe from the Euro, we must leave the EU. We don't need the EU. There is a higher rate of unemployment within the EU than out of it. Not only will we be safe from the Euro, but we will be able to be a seperate country, have our own laws... Tips on getting drunk on little money:   -Drink on an empty stomach. -Drink as much as you can. -Drink the strong stuff. -Mixing your alcohols wont get you any more drunk; but will give you a hang-over -But remember to stop before you have had too much. -Other ways to get a hangover are:>Port                                   >Brandy                                   >Cheap red wine. -Avoid doing what i told you to do to keep sober. Exams   Today I had my first proper exam day. Previously I have only had Art and English litterature. Today I had Geography in the morning, One hour of sunbathing, half an hour of football, an hour of sitting around talking (in the sun) and then a Biology exam. I finished both exams in good time, which I am rather pleased about. But why is it that even when I finish the paper, I still manage to get a bad mark? I can't believe that stupid Swiss referee disallowed Campbell's goal. England beat Portugal in the match last night, and the w***** took it on to extra time and penalties. But I would like to congratulate Portugal. They scored two very good goals, and the goal keeper played very well. I have recently becaume a member of a Star Wars RPG (Role Play Game).

The tested sentence is:  I just noticed the Ads by Google banner at the top of the page which had picked up on Rich and Lisa's friendly discussion on the merits of woodwind instruments.  Google is helpfully advertising clarinets, french horns, instrument cases, etc.  Now, after my initial post which included the term "leather whips" I'm a bit fearful of Google's ingenuity. Phew!  After working with a team of top rocket scientists I finally figured out how to join Four Lads...and there was much rejoicing.  I have been reading the posts from afar as I was unable to officially join and have enjoyed the banter.  Hopefully, I'll be able to make this as much a part of my day as breakfast cereal and leather whips.  Cheers. I'll be out of touch for about a week while I go visit people in the vicinity of the Mouse and company. This really is vacation for me since there are no relatives involved and there is nothing remotely business related to interfere with my time off. Although it seems when I take trips like these the most unexpected things seem to occur. The last such jaunt, about a year ago, ended with an interesting trip to a nudist colony (For your own safety do not create a mental image). Quite a new experience for me. Ask me about it some time if you need to laugh. Check out this  urlLink link   for instructions on doing a hardware defrag on your drive. urlLink  This Pearls Before Swine  describes my day perfectly. I'm thinking of making my own Mallet O' Understanding only mine will reach through the phone. ;) OK, hereâ€™s an interesting chain of emails between Lisa and I.  A bit of background:    â€¢	Rickâ€™s fourth-grade recorder concert is tomorrow night, and Rick was trying to cram all of his practicing into the day before.  As Lisa and I discussed this, I remembered that the sign-up form for fifth-grade band is due this week. â€¢	I started playing the violin in 4th grade.  I starting playing trumpet in 6th grade and switched to French horn in band in 8th grade. â€¢	Lisa was not in band. â€¢	My fourth-grade son, Rick, has the uncanny ability to irritate my wife to heights not measurable by science.  I am pretty sure he got that from me. â€¢	Because of the late time I usually get home from work, Lisa does most of the helping with homework.  OK, off we goâ€¦   From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:03 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  BTW, have you seen the sign-up for band next year (just a half-sheet)?  I had it next to my chair this weekend.  I have not talked to you (or him) about it, but I think we should think about it depending on how much he enjoyed the recorder.  Just think how much more annoying heâ€™d be with a clarinetâ€¦  Rich    From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:07 PM Subject: RE:   Tuesday night   I found the band slip today and it is set out to look at tonight.  Lisa   From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:08 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  OK.  By the way, I was joking about the clarinet.  No woodwinds.  Ever.  Rich    Here is where it begins to get fun.      From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:14 PM Subject: RE:   Tuesday night  Just who made you the boss of music and when did woodwinds get such a bad rap?  I actually think that the violin would be worse that a woodwind at the beginning any day. Any instrument   is going to be extremely painful at the beginning and why would you worry   about it when most of the practicing would happen on my watch?  Lisa    OK, at this point I am not sure if she is joking or not.  Had we been talking on the phone or in person, I would have been able to tell.  Rather than backing off and seeing if I had offended somehow, I decided to keep going and see what happens.   Two additional points of background: I have an agreement with Lisa that I will set a good example for our kids and eat everything except for squash and zucchini.  I hate them and will never eat them.  Ever again.   I am also can be quite a snob when it comes to music.  There are specific things that I dislike and certain things that I am unreasonably stubborn about.  For example, the only way to listen to Handelâ€™s Hallelujah Chorus is with orchestra and chorus.  No rock or pop remixes for me, thanks.  Anyways, back to the obnoxiousnessâ€¦    From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:019 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  I made myself the boss of music.  Right after I banned zucchini and squash from my plate.  I keep my music snobbery hidden most of the time.  Woodwinds bring it out of me.  Donâ€™t ask me to explain why.  I get from my dad he - had the same rule.    Yes, violins sound about as bad at first.  Ask Keith.  I worry about becauseâ€¦ I am the boss of music.  Rich    OK, I was just goofing around.  I really do not consider myself the boss of music, but it was too good to pass up. My dad really did have that rule.  We could play any instrument we wanted but not the clarinet.  No squeaks.  I do have fond memories of my Keith, my brother, running upstairs and screaming in pain while I practiced my violin in fourth grade.      From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:26 PM Subject: RE:   Tuesday night  Well, just so you make your feelings clear.  I was a little unsure about how you felt before so I thought I'd poke around in it a little to find out how you really felt.  I am just so glad that you have named yourself the boss.  It's good to recognize delusional behavior when you hear it.    Also, violins are definitely worse.  Lisa    Off to the races.     From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:19 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  You are only jealous because you are not The Boss of Music (please note the capital letters).  Early violin players are not worse than early woodwind players.    While they are not much better (which I did admit in my previous note), it is that subtle distinction that makes violins acceptable and woodwinds not.  Rich   Not wanting to appear like a pompus buffoon, I made sure that I pointed out that I did admit that beginning violin players sound awful.  But Lisa came back with the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch:    From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May  17, 2004 3:39 PM Subject: RE:   Tuesday night  Then I will make it my mission in life to encourage all three of our children to choose a woodwind instrument.    Rick will play the clarinet, Tori the sax and Drew the bassoon.  They will perform concerts for you each evening when you come home and you will have to smile and clap after each song.  Lisa    Ouch, that would just be painful.  Lacking any good comeback I counted to five (three, sir), I decided to distract her with chocolate.   From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:53 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  Right.  In order to do that, you would have to get them to all agree to play the instrument YOU wanted them to play.  Maybe you could talk one or maybe two into it, but not all three.  Unless you told Drew that the bassoon was also a rocket launcher.  Did I mention that we have a  whole cooler of ice cream treats free for employee consumption?  The Turtle ice cream bar is pretty good.  Yummmmâ€¦   The fact that I get free ice cream bars at work (really good ones) for a few weeks should distract her from the fact that I have run out of witty responses.  I know the free Starbucks coffee I get at work was particuarlly irritating.     From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 4:04 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night  You have no idea the power of a mother.   They wouldn't even know what hit them and they will think that it's their own idea.   Maybe I'll even let them know that this is all a scheme to torture their father and they will share in my joy.  Go ahead and eat all of the ice cream you'd like but remember that we don't have any money to buy bigger pants.  Lisa    I think my wifeâ€™s friends at this point are next to here making whooping noises, high-fiving each other and going â€œyou go, girl!â€?.  Feeling worked over like the last pair of black sandles at a Payless show store during a â€œBuy 1 get 2 Freeâ€? sale, I decide to retreat, eat a strawberry ice-cream sandwich, and see if I can salvage this little exchange (I am not optimistic).  Work then intruded for a while.  Having forgotten that Rickâ€™s recorder concert tomorrow and his frantic last-minute practicing is what began this whole discussion, I was blown away by Lisaâ€™s next email:    From: Lisa Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 4:25 PM Subject: Tuesday Night  I have now decided that there is nothing as bad as recorder practice.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 25th time. The tested sentence is:  Seriously, you have got to go and look at this.Its one of the oddest, and strangely addictive things on the interent. If anyone can work out quite how it works, please tell me. urlLink There is no one of earth alive to day that has ever commited an action completely devoid of greed. We are all greedy.Stuff love and hate, the most important human emotion is greed, or personal want. This drives every thing. Every other emotion we expreience stems from this: Love - want of someone, Hate - want of something negative to happen to someone or something, jealousy - want of someone elses things.Each action we make on a day to day basis is decided by what we, at that time, as a human being, want to do to make us feel right. No one has ever done ANYTHING solely for someone else. There is always a payoff, even if it is only feeling good about ourselves, that we factor into the equation of deciding what to do. The result of the event might be more negative than the result of another choice we could have made, but no one has ever made a descision based entirely on someone elses want. How coudl they, as part of doing that is to want to do something for someone else, therefore making you feel better.No matter how charitable you are, there is no choice you make, no action you take, that has not taken into account, in however small part, your own feelings and wants.Thus, each and every single one of us is greedy, its just a matter of degree. This is Pointy. Drew him myself. One of the only pieces of drawing I have ever done that I like....  urlLink     Posted by  urlLink Hello Well, its Wednesday. As I speak, there is about 2/3 of my year sittting in an exam hall, doing their French listening, and tomorrow its my turn, with my German listening. Then, after that, I've got my IT exam, and then we really enter into the fray, with English language, and loads of others in quick succession. I always thought that when it came to this time, I'd pull my act together. For two years, I have staved off all my worries about how little work I was doing with the soothing knowledge, that come exam time, I'd buck my ideas up, and do some serious fucking work. Unfortunatly, this has entirely failed to happen. I'm screwed, and I know it. I can see the end of tunnel, and the only light is one with 'YOU'VE FAILED' emblazoned on it. Fuck Fuck Fuck.All the way through my school career, GCSEs have seemed so far off. The seemingly ulitmate milestone that we all have to pass, but you never think you will. They have always seemed so far away, a distant goal to strive for, but one that'll never happen. However, they are happening. They are round the corner. In my veiw, after these, childhood is lost. That sounds so fucking pretentious, but thats what it feels like. I mean, for 11 years, I have been at school, and in sight, just, all this time have been these exams, but they've always been so far away that any progress towards them is unoticable. However, we're there. All at once, they go from just something you think about every so often to RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW. And I don't like it... Mummy, I wanna be little again..... It is strange how, once you have got an idea in your head that you want to be true, an ideal that you want the world to fit to, your mind can twist almost any piece of infomation, even direct evidence to the contary, so that to you, it appears that ideal is on its way to being achievied. Its a mental survival trait, in my opinon. If this ability was removed, the entire human race would begin to slowly turn into manic depressives. Its affects would not be apparent immeadiatly, but as more and more people realised that the driving force behind thier life, the one thing that made their worth living was in fact a great big pile of huge fucking dog shite, human soceity would begin to turn in on itself. If everyone had reasonable, sensible goals, then life couldn't work on a day to day basis. There we sat, the four of us - my mum, my dad, my aunt and me. Munching on a curry in a lovely indian restaurant, chatting nicely about my grandma. About how she would love the restaurant, and how nice her garden is looking. Completely ignoring the fact that as we spoke, about 150 miles away, she was in a hospice, slowly dying of cancer. Carefully skirting round the subject, tiptoeing round any mention of how she actually was, of the fact she had days to live.Well, shes dead now, and the funeral has taken place, and it was awful, and derpessing, but its done with, and I'll never forget her. However, it still gets to me. The way soceity's taboos and opinions stop any discussion of serious issues, things that need to be talked about, in any other situation apart form the extremes of emotions. We were sat there, casually disscussing my grannie's fuschia bushes, all of us knowing she'd be dead in days, and that it really didn't matter, and all of us with these feelings we needed to talk about, but couldn't, so we focussed on the parts of her life which weren't to hot to touch. Ah well. Rest in Peace, Jean and Richard Pendle Well, here I am. Hopefully at the the start of a great thing, prehaps a great adventure. Or prehaps I'll get bored of this in a few weeks, like I normally do, and neglect this, until it dies, alone and tired, like a hobo whose reached the end of his miserable existance.Well, its a Sunday afternoon, and I've managed, again, to spend far too long on the PC. An unproductive week, followed by an equally unrpoductive weekend, with a worrying lack of work. Ah well Right, almost there. Its weird to think they're actually over.Ah well, soon the summer will be here, along with seemingly endless summer evenings, the sun, the heat and more fun than you can shake a medium sized stick at.Have just finished my History paper, and its interesting. For some reason, I have suddenly become interested in the things I was writing about. For instance, before the exam, I couldn't give a toss about how Hungary left the Soviet Union in 1956, but now, after having written tw opages on it for my GCSE, I feel this strange urge to go back and find out what really happened.... I met the happiest person in the world yesterday.Yesterday, the window cleaner came over. It was a bit annoying to have so many people in the house, with three window cleaners traipsing through the house, so I went out into the garden for a smoke.  While I was out there, the head window cleaner came over and asked for a light. We sat on the bench of the garden for a bit, and chatted.  The guys fucking wicked. He comes over once every eight weeks or so, and has done for years, but I've never spoken to him properly before, just noticed he was a cheerful fellow. Now I've actually talked to him, I've come to the conclusion that he is in fact the embodiment of happiness.   We were talking about window cleaning, and how fucking hard it must be to do some of the complex windows in our house, like the roof of the conservatory, and the windows above it. From here, we got chatting about his life. The guy actually has no worries at all. He's got a job he enjoys. He doesn't earn very much for it, but enough to haev his own house, nad hes got a family. He works when he wants to, he goes out when he wants. Hes the kind of person who just reminds you of sunny days, for some reason. I reckon it would be impossible to be even mildly depressed around him. Its weird. Hes got this kind of happiness that doesn't grate, or get on your nerves, or piss you off at all. He just kinda.... radiates. Unworried by anything.  Nice bloke  Thats about it, really  Dave Ok, for five years I have been learning biology. I have had two teachers, one of whom was nice, and friendly, and liked me, and one of whom to which I think the best comparison that can be drawn is Satan. With a Northern  accent.    Mrs Lunter, the Birmingham/Bath Satan was evil. Pure and simple. She also had, seemingly, powers gifted to her by some unknown, unnatural force.    With her, an hour lesson would turn into five hours. In other hour long science lessons we might look at and write about a quarter of what we do in biology. Not a lesson to be drowsy for, or even mildly not with it.    Added to this, she hated me. There were only three people in her class who she'd taught from year eight, and all three of us were not, as you might call it, perfect students. We were all capable, as she kept reminding us, in a voice you'd more expect to be saying something along the lines of 'Feeling lucky, Punk', but we had 'application difficulties'. This was the result of one major problem with our timetabling, which meant we had to hand in biology homework on a day we didn't have a lesson, a complex process for me even know, with my sieve-like memory, but for the year eight dave, with his lack of developed excuse ability, it was hell. I couldn't do it for the life of me, and could never find a reason I couldn't, except that I couldn't quite get my head around the concept, which apparently wasn't good enough. But yeah, she hated me then, and still does. I often, in the past two years, had to seek safety behind my rugby-playing friend Matt to avoid being asked every single question she could think of. Anytime I got one right, a grunt was heard. Anytime I got one wrong, I got a lecture on how intelligent I could be, if only I'd APPLY myself.   And so, after five years of biology, and four years of heart attacks, stressed mornings spent working out what I was going to say, and lectures, and evil glances at parents evenings, I've finished with biology. Thats it. Five years of teaching, condensed into one hour and a half of exam. And at that, an hour and a half of a suprisingly easy paper. Up yours Mrs Lunter. In some ways I want to get an A* to prove I can apply myself, but in other ways, I don't, just to prove you wrong. Still, thanks for the Penguin Bar on my birthday, and the rare times we had when you weren't threatening me. I shall never forget you, nor you cruel jokes at me, and the amount of times I have described you as harshly as possibly, only to find you standing behind me. You, cruel, cold-hearted, yet oddly  effective  teacher. I know more biology off by heart than any other subject, yet you have caused me mor epain than any other teacher I ahve ever had. Except Mr Medhurst. But at least he has comic relief built in, in the form of his near overwhelming bulk. Now, today, as I sat down to my regular breakfast, at 1pm (isn't study leave bloody marvellous?) I came across something interesting in the Guardian.Apparently, female infiedelity is genetic. This sounds so wrong at first, but in fact, scientific studies on twins and on non-related women have discovered that certain women carry a gene that encourages the lady in question to remain less faithful to their supposed life partner than others.This raises an odd point. Does this mean the masculine urge to be unfaithful is just with all of us penis-bearing ones from birth? Are we genetical coded to be unfaithful, whoever we are? Surely this gives us a fair excuse? I mean, we cannot be blamed if its in our genes, surely? Its only logic that if our body tells us to, then our mind has no control? I think that if ever a man gets caught with a bit on the side in the future that this should hold as a strong defense. It would be like divorcing someone for farting.However, another point it raises is the question of how far our birth state influences our behaviour in the rest of our life. If there is a gene that does this, then whose to say there isn't a gene that makes someone act more polite than another, or anything like that. Since our actions are based on our emotions, and the emotions we are feeling are based at least in part to the chemical state of our brain at the time, then surely it makes logical sense to assume that certain personality traits could have been hard coded from birth. The problem is with this is that if it were true, then how much can you blame someone for their actions? Is it right to punish something they are wired to do? We punish pyschopaths, yes, and they are proven to be... 'different'. Yet we almost do this not for the fact this person has behaved morally wrong, but to keep ourselves safe by encouraging a different set of behaviours. Surely, if someone is genetically inclined to steal things, and has no control over whether they do it, it is wrong on our part to cause them pain, emotional or physical, for doing so? I tried to avoid making this yet another 'today I did this, today I did that' blog, but this just has to be said:If you ever, ever, ever get the chance, never, ever, ever mix beer with vodka.I know this would seem to be obvious, but its a serious point.No matter how drunk I get in the future, I will never do this againUrgh
+++++ THE GENDER: MALE equals to: MALE
ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 26th time. The tested sentence is:  Upsie Daisy, Downsie Daisy   Sometimes life's good.  Sometimes life's bad.  And sometimes I feel queasy, because I really can't tell if things are going up or down -- I know it's definitely motile, even if it's just resonating back and forth.  I recently came upon  urlLink Tinka's blog , and found myself.  It felt like looking through a mirror!  How exact are her words, in describing how I'm feeling?  All her uncertainties, frustration, her endurance and her yield of control -- I don't know what it is, but her blog seems to say all the things that I am afraid to admit in my own blog.  It's kind of spooky, actually -- it felt like some sort of alter-ego voice telling me that I need to be more honest with myself.   I'm feeling a bit low these days, obviously because of the gargantuan amount of work that I do.  Had it been something more meaningful, like something to give me experience in my future career, or like saving the world, I would not be this stressed and unhappy.  There.  I said it.  I'm unhappy.  Many things are not going right, and I've been putting up with them silently.  I've been bitching and moaning on my blog for sure, but I was in denial.  I am unhappy, and now I admit it.   While I certainly do feel ready for a relationship, sometimes I doubt myself.  I am conflicted.  There's a conflict of interest.  Am I wanting to get into a relationship because I truly seek my other half (or temporary space-filler, at the least) or because I'm just really really lonely and utterly lost?  It's one of those things I ask myself frequently.  If I were dating a man (hypothetically speaking -- long term), and he proposed, what would I say?  My biggest fear would be that I would say yes.  Normally, that would be a cause for celebration, but underneath the very bottom layer of my heart, I would be questioning myself.  Am I marrying this man, because I truly love him, or am I marrying to get myself out of this horrid situation (a.k.a. "go fuck yourself USCIS!")?   Perhaps that is the reason for my growing ill-sentiment for marriage.  It is one of my greatest fears, to be lying to myself.  But sometimes, it's not as simple as thinking things over a night of sleep.  How can I admit that I am only seeking a relationship because of sheer, utter loneliness, when I really don't know?  How would I know if I am truly ready for such human bonding?   I always want to bust out of this "it pays the bills" job and do the things I really want to do -- I was meant to do.  But I don't know what it is!  It's the most difficult thing.  For a good 10 years, all I ever wanted to do was become a doctor.  Become an MD, and work in third-world countries.  Fight AIDS.  When I get too feeble and old to work under harsh conditions, I will come back and teach, to install the same passion for humanitarianism to the younger generations.  For 10 years, that was what I wanted to do!  But a second passes by.  60 of those are a minute, and then 60 of those are an hour, and 24 of those are a day, and years passed by.  Now I am turning 24 (again with the age thing!), frightened out of my mind!  I am getting older each year, without becoming any wiser.  The clock is ticking, and I still don't know where I'm going.   This whole "going to medical school" business was as good as set in stone for me.  I could not imagine myself doing anything else.  It was my "calling."  I was so happy to have found my "calling" because I know so many people who wander aimlessly, just doing what feels "ok" -- not even what feels "right" -- and wasting their precious time on this planet -- people, we get, at the most, about a century, and that's if we're lucky.  It would be nice if we could live until we were 600 years old like Moses, but apparently, that's not too commonplace these days!  Also, it seems that nothing is "set in stone" unless it literally is.   My dreams of medical school flopped.  Now I have drifted away from the sciences and math.  If I ever get my bachelor's degree, I would be in my late 20's.  Would I ever make it to medical school?  I am not so sure -- I have lost faith in my greymatter.  I can no longer recite page after page from memory for the sheer joy of shocking my classmates.  Heck, I can barely stay awake through a paragraph.  And I also have more fun reading for English classes, rather than biology texts.   So now that my life-long planning has flopped, where to, and how?  Would I be as passionately motivated?  So many quesitons, so little answers.  I used to be one smart kid.  Now I'm an astonishingly average, mediocre young adult, and pretty soon, I'll be   old   and the twinkle in my eyes will have dulled to a mirky brown color, reflecting the muddiness of my capabilities as a human being.  How can I have a relationship when I'm so uncertain?  I don't know whether I'm coming or going.  How can I break loose from the hells of a cell phone store, when I really have no clue if there's something better out there?   Speaking of outrageous fears... I know I'm digressing again, but somehow, I feel like this is the time to write it out.   Every child has fears.  Most have fears of the boogey man, vampires, monsters.  Fortunately, no monsters hid under my bed to devour me the moment my parents went to bed and the lights were off.  I feared no monster, no ghost, no werewolves.  I feared murderers who escaped from prison.  I feared psychopathic child-molesters.  I feared rapists, at an age when I did not know what rape was.   When I grow up, and make a whole lotta money, I need to go plop down on a psychiatrist's couch and start my much-needed, years of therapy.   I won't go into details, but at that tender, sweet age (ok, so I don't remember the exact age) of seven or so, I was wronged.  I don't know what the word would be to describe it.  It wasn't rape.  Sexual assault?  Can you sexually assault a 7-year-old who doesn't know what sex is?  If a man grabbed your child-self and threatened with a sharp blade in the middle of the night, and you don't remember it for the next 6 years, did it still happen?  Sometimes I ask myself if I am imagining things, because sometimes I do.  I imagine bad things, to see if they seem real enough -- it's my personal gage to measure whether or not a certain bad misfortune could happen to me.  Like becoming paralyzed in a car crash.  I try to imagine that happening to me, but I can't make it feel real.  So in some mystical, internal way, I tell myself that it won't happen to me.  I try to imagine myself leaving the US, never to return.  No matter how hard I try, I can't make that image become alive.  So I tell myself, if I can't even imagine it, it won't happen.  But can I see myself with a man, not even a man, a boy, just twice my age of seven, to do things to me that I can't even write, let alone say?  Too often, I see myself in the same predicament, and the story plays out exactly the same, every time.   Oh yes, the pain.  The years of suffering.  Not really.  I'm a tough cookie, as  urlLink Christopher  says.  I don't want to become the next basket case woman who cried wolf.  Even I read magazine articles of women, who had been date-raped and what-not, and roll my eyes, and say to myself, "not another one."  Rape doesn't make you special.  Getting touched in your special place by Michael Jackson doesn't make you special.  I don't want to be Hellen Keller.  I don't my biography to say, "despite all her misfortunes... blah blah blah."   I'll tell you what my biggest misfortune is.  It is this curse.  That I have to write.  As I child, I read a story about a girl who bought a pair of red shoes although she was warned not to.  She puts on the red shoes and dances forever and ever, through thorny vines and all, and finally has to have her feet amputated and replaced by wooden pegs or something.  I'm hazy on the details, but you get the picture.  I'm the girl who has to write and write and write and write, to no avail.  On the surface it seems therapeutic, but the more I get into it, the more of my ugly self I see, and the devastation is just too gory for me to bear.   Yes.  I'm a nutcase.  I bask in the juices of my misery, smothered in the gross tar pit of my own despair. T H U M P. . . THUMP. . THUMP. . thump, thththththththththth... The beating of my heart at a speed of 200-beats-per-minute woke me -- it thumped so hard that there was pain.  When my eyes adjusted to the brightness around me, I knew I was free, at least temporarily. When will it stop?  These nightmares -- the brutal killings, sinister villains, and my own impotent measures for escape -- come more frequently than ever.  Even as a child I was never one to cry awake in the middle of the night from a bad dream.  In fact, I was such a sound sleeper, I barely even remembered some dreams, and those that I remembered were just  gae-ggoom , a dog-dream, which means a dream that has no meaning.   Now an adult, I wake up because my own piercing shrills awaken me from what shouldn't be called slumber.  The dilated blood vessels form red cracks in the whites of my eyes, and I am always left panting for air.  The moon floods the room with an iridescent light, and it is the witching hour.  There is momentary silence, a vacuum, if you will, until reality creeps in and I can adjust to it, and hear the chirping of crickets outdoor, and the neighbor's cat making love calls. Early this morning I had such a dream -- one that also left me out of breath from fright and one that made my eyelids slap open, like one of those blinds that roll up in cartoons when a little string is tugged.  I saw the red LED numbers on my alarm clock -- 08:00.  It was a dream.  But was it a dream?  When you try to explain a dream, the harder you try to make sense of it, the more confusing it becomes.  I can only say that mine was of terrorism.  Men in head-to-toe orange came in, ravaged women and beat the men, killing them in the most brutal fashion -- no, not kill -- as death would have been too merciful.  In my dream people lay with their eyes wide open, forced to watch the continuation of atrocities as they happen -- no solace would be granted.  I scream, but no sound is made -- I am in a vacuum.  I am in a vacuum because there are two conflicting positions -- if I scream, the terrorists would surely hurt me too -- if I don't scream... how can I not, when a man's skull was cracked open before my own eyes? Cruel eyes -- why must you see?  I want to shut them -- I want to be rid of this, but my lids won't come down, they just won't close -- I have to see.  I want to persuade, I want to yell out "stop" but my tongue is frozen solid, and so are my legs, firmly planted where I stood, in the middle of madness, midst of a frenzy that was an overload for my sensory nerves.  Too much to handle, and I'll break down.  I must do something, but I am paralyzed. They say that dreams reflect you, at an unconscious level -- maybe about someone you love, or happily eating mountains of carbs, or perhaps your fears.  It is only after the nightmare starts to fade that it becomes clear -- I am leading a life of paralysis.  I need to move, but I can't, because I am afraid to move, but I still need to move, and I still can't, and I am still afraid.  A vicious circle.  Paralyzed with fear.  The most cruel thing to do to yourself -- and yes, it is something I inflict on myself -- I am a victim of my own doings.   The nightmares come more frequently these nights.  I pull up the blankets, upto my nose, with trembling hands, preparing for another battle within. Los Angeles.  What can I say about the city of corruption, of filth, of savages?  Los Angeles has a reputation, a myth, a legend of sorts -- it is the land of endlessly sunny days, tall palm trees wading in the cool Pacific breeze.  People wear sunglasses and smile.  The perfect brochure to lure fools searching for gold.  Truth is, LA will swallow you whole, and you too, will join and be one with the sordid conditions of the city.   There are Republicans, and even more Democrats, and even more powerless victims.  Quarrels ensue in the name of a government for the the people and by the people, but in the end, everyone knows, the scapegoats are plain to see.  The deserving poor, the ones not speaking the language, the ones with different colored skin, the ones who don't have houses on the beach.  Cut public education.  Cut the arts and music.  Kill the animals at the shelter, ASAP.  Don't give them a chance to be found!   The blaming game continues.  Who mishandled what budget and what movie star governor is definitely not terminating his staff, and in fact, increasing their pay.  Fingers are pointed, but nothing gets accomplished.  A seemingly civilized witch hunt for everything.  Outwardly civil, inwardly evil. You'd think of bronzed gods and buxom beauties, strutting down the streets in a lux saunter, flashing pearly white teeth, waving as though they were on a pageant.  Instead, the truth is that toothless and homeless dwell, covered in insane amounts of dirt and dust, overlooked unless they scare you with the flashing of the whites of their eyes.   Restaurants proudly display a letter grade of "A" on their windows, a grade lower and even baser than the scarlet letter, because it is bought not earned.  Back alleys are crowded with roach colonies, some big as mice.  You can hear them run when you turn on the lights, their hairy legs brushing against the darkness, stealthily.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 27th time. The tested sentence is:  The 4 tile mural I worked a week on went into the kiln,along with everything else, and thankfully everything was ok except the mural.  The underglaze was too thick, and the glaze was too thick (I decided to float glaze the tile for fear of smearing all the black.)  The glaze actually picked up the black, moved it over, and then fired in a big blob in several spots.  Live and learn.  I just don't know if I have it in me to make another one.   I'll have to dig deep for this one.  I guess I should be thinking of the kiln as half full instead of half empty! I'm so tired today because I was up all night worrying about the kiln firing.  It smelled something fierce, and I was worried we were all going to die of carbon monoxide poisoning in our sleep.  Plus, I kept hearing banging, which I hope wasn't anything exploding in the kiln, but I haven't found out yet because it's still 600 degrees the next day. I happily called the lady about the tile mural that was just set to see how great it looked.  To my suprise, she was very shocked at how warped the tiles look when set.  I was so upset I had nightmares all night and obsessed about it all day. Luckily, she called me back the next day to apologize because she was in a bad mood.  P.s.  Their check was returned the next day. Today I must get 100 bisque white tiles today.  My supplier of 7 years has my order of 4 weeks ago delayed in Mexico in customs.  Note to self:  Remember Murphy.  Never assume anything. MUST PAY SALES TAXES TODAY OR ELSE!  Something about a deadline is a sure cure to get one off one's butt.  Yesterday placed a free ad in the local paper. Cost for free, and for free stuff-This should be VERY interesting to see the response. This week I should test some cone 5 glazes just for the heck of it. fired the last mural.  now I'm depressed.  it's kind of like planning a wedding all year and then the day after you have nothing to do.  Not that I have nothing to do, just no one telling me what I have to do. (work orders) I could have been better prepared with a summer camp to fall into; I'm certainly getting phone calls.  But I was too sick to plan a couple of months ago."If you fail to plan, you plan to fail!"  On another note, I am regretting not buying the small test kiln.  Twice , and now three times I have lost a customer or an opportunity because I didn't have a smaller kiln to do test tiles in or cone 10, or whatever.  I will be getting one soon. make hump molds make slab shapes:  babies, women,large star windchimes, small stars make multi-level vase  garden tiles or initial tiles peacock tray baby stuff for daniel-frame w letters, ornament, train plaque,send tiles for footprints(also to Liz) mix colored dipping glazes in quart containers from Smart and Final marketing tools needed: scout flyers party flyers new maps or general flyers summer camp schedule flyers baby footprint postcards fix website babyfootprint gift certificates well, the Robinson mural worked out.  4 tiles cracked or broken, all re-painted.  Hope they like them.  The Cordillera mural is getting bigger everyday, now 75 more tiles than anticipated.  They look beautiful going into the kiln.  Double stilting them for less warping.  Had a chance to teach a self-portrait class for children;one of my favorites.  This week had my second student for handmade tiles who wants to go into business as such.  After a little trepidation, I gave into the fact that I am a teacher, and so I teach.  She however wants to learn clay crafting, versus painting, so this is fun.  Got to break open my plaster, and discovered I have a love-hate relationship with plaster carving. Thought it might be easier if I colored the plaster in three after mixing the batch and pour it in layers, so you could see what you are doing. I do love pouring molds. I have a school painting on Monday.  For some reason I have a total mental block about the glazes.  Couldn't get the bottles I want,don't want to use the old ones.  Debating which glazes to use, the yucky cheap ones, or the nice expensive ones.  Usually, I have no choice.  I just don't want to spend any more money on half-used glazes. I have a hundred different colors, but not enough of any one to fill 12 bottles. Well, I got a call from the mural organizer who asked if the tiles would be ready to view tomorrow.  Of course, I hadn't even re-fired the tiles yet, or done the two "dog paw" accents, or the tile that no one wanted to paint, or the stupid 4 tile center.  So I had to fess up, and beg for more time.  Of course, now that my rear is on the line, I managed to become amazingly inspired and finish the two accent tiles while my kids got ready for school.  I cancelled a doctor's appointment, and painted the stupid center.  Not perfect and beautiful like the last one, but it's there at least.  Now the dilemma of how lazy do I want to be?  Should I leave it black and white, or color it in, and if I color it in, how much color should I bother with?  Or is it passable as it is?  Mostly, I just fear total failure like the last time. The great news is the mural I started working on last year, I was asking $6/tile.  At that rate I wasn't going to get anywhere, so I asked for $8/tile.  I've waited a year, and the lady felt so bad, she said they would give me $10/tile..Yippee! Today I need to start mixing glazes for the last tile painting for the school year.  The question is can I get 200 of the new nozzle bottles I tried out this weekend by Friday shipped and filled?  Or should I go with what I have , which now seems like crap compared.  They of course will never know the difference.  Re-painting 2 tiles that broke, refiring two broken tiles, and refiring 6" tiles that the glaze didn't flatten out all the way.  Must be done asap because they are setting this weekend, and has already been delayed once.  Guess I better start re-painting those stupid 4 part mural tiles.  Ugh! Today I had a glass artist over for a firing.  It was a good excuse to do some research on fused glass.  My past attempt at painted,fused, and slumped glass turned out so-so.  I have some material already, so it would be nice to learn how to use it properly.  She is an older woman, and I had a nice time talking about glass with her; how she sells her stuff (in Venezuela), and just about life as an artist.  I custom programmed my kiln (she usually does it manually).  It was interesting to know that you can open a red hot flaming kiln with glass inside with no breakage.  I can't wait to see what is inside.  Learned about cutting glass, slumping in bisque, applying enamels to gum arabic through a sifter, using elmers glue to stick shards of glass together, using a metallic sharpie to write with on glass, and firing inclusions and dichroic glass.  Like to test frit on clay and glass.  baking soda makes bubbles between glass (use sparingly).Use of fiber paper vs. kiln wash.  slump at a higher temperature and fire paint at a lower temp to keep intensity of color.Use ceramic frames for drop molds (dishes)  Cracked bisque works fine as a glass saggar!  Attending NCECA in San Diego in 2003 was a turning point for me in many ways.  Little did I know when several people asked if I was going, that it was more than I could have imagined.  I went reluctantly, tired from work, but curious.  When I got there I was lost, and wandered aimlessly, not knowing what I had walked into.  I paid my $65, and set off to see what it was that everyone thought was so great.  I wandered in and out of lectures and demonstrations.  I was most interested in the business lectures, only really wanting to find a way to make a living doing what I love.  I wandered through exhibits, spying the mug sale, the cone box contest, and the k-12 children's entries.  Was my stuff up to par with the "real" teachers who had a degree?  I vowed I would enter next year, just to be competitive.(I didn't , but that's another story).  I was really excited to go to the basement area where everyone was selling everything. Tools I didn't know existed, schools beckoning (asking myself, how would my life had been different if I had majored in ceramics, and not married and had children), companies throwing samples my way by the caseloads.  Paper, paper, and more paper. The next day was better, knowing that I was there to learn as much as possible in a short time period. I sat through lectures and demos. I absorbed conversations and watched people look and watch.    When I got back home to my studio, I wasn't the same.  When I left, I was a housewife that had more than a passing interest in a hobby.  I was an entrepeneur, trying to find the holy grail that would catapault me from sometimes breaking even to supporting myself.    When I came back, I felt like an artist.  I realized I knew much more than I thought.  I realized that the real world experience I had jumped into blindly had given me more opportunity than most people get in a lifetime of study.  I saw my life 20 years from now, and 40 years from now, planning what I would like to do when the kids are grown and this season of my life had passed.  I saw myself, 70 years old, touching the clay and asking the questions......  First , when I got back to work, I was engulfed by production and exploring new avenues of business.  I taught with a new confidence, that yes, I knew what I was doing with what I did, and everything else would come later.  I experimented more, and slowly the studio became a studio, not a storefront.  I had an apprentice, and a muse.  I would spend hours with the music on, in the silent of my space, pondering the next projects, or working with ferocity.  I realized the sacrifices I had made as an artist, in my ventures as a businesswoman.  I had no extra time or energy to "create" for the sake of creating, going into the unknown with no "agenda".  I did not know what that felt like.    I closed the studio. It felt like death.  Where was my purpose without a store to support?  I hated being just a mother.  I almost couldn't do it, and didn't have to.  I had renegotiated my lease for pennies.  But I knew I had to cut off my arm for another one to grow literally.  I moved the studio to my home, like a lot of potters do.  I am lucky that I have patient people who live with me that accept the studio taking over the whole of the house.  The driveway, the garage, the courtyard, the livingroom, the office, even in the bedroom.

They should!  I will write them because they took an uneccessary beating because of the mistake.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 28th time. The tested sentence is:  its not good to feel like killing yourself over continuing to go to school is it? mmmmm summer is almost here .......BUT i still have finals to get through and that blows like an anal dwelling butt monkey from the movie bruce almighty anyways, thats all folks  hey andrewy This is bad. I get to see my queeny for only 18 days before the end of July. I am going to Philmont, she's goign to europe, virginia, and some place else. And so i am going to make the days we have together fun, etc. Ball game, six flags, driving range, swimmng, go carts. Idk what else but its going to be fun.   I want to take stephie camping sometime. Idk how that would work out with our parents though. mmm yep i had a couple other ideas but we will see how and if they work out.   g-night SO! we started out iwth an exam today. Chemistry. Not that bad. I could still think after i had turned it in, which i had thought was a good sign. So it was alright test. I had only messed up on two or three minor things. I hope i come out with an A.   NOw to study spanish and english. Today is my first REAL post.  Andy did the other one for me.  Anyway, I am not a guest like andy was at jeffs im a CO-AUTHOR just so anyone reading this knows.  Oh, and if you think its silly that my bf and i are sharing a blog or mushy oh well.  I don't know how much it will get updated though cuz neither of us does a good job of that as you will see from the other ones if you go there.  In any case, I'm very excited because I have less than two weeks of school left and then it's summer and I get to leave for Europe and Virginia and Em is getting married :)))) and chicago, etc.  Also time with friends and things.          Right now I'm kind of depressed.  I don't know why.  I guess school can't end soon enough.  I hate acting like a stupid kid drooling over the highest grade so I will get into some great college.  I want a lot more.  Anyway, it rained yesterday! I love the rain :)        Alright that's about it.  Adios. Yikes so today was basically the count down. The review give out. The begging of the end of the school year, dont' worry i am pretty sure that the end of the world is at a later date. Only God can tell though. SO anyways i was completely unprepared for today, all i did last night was a art project, which was due last quater i might add. I ABSOLUTELY MUST finish my english paper due last wed or friday and i must finish an extra credit deal for mr. donahoe (the 92cent meals). Yep so i basically ate like a person on welfare would for about a week. It wasn't that bad acutally. I had peanut butter and jellly for lunch, ramam  noodles, eggs for breakfast, pretzels, and tv dinners oh and i had a few apples. THis is not that bad of a meal. THe only problem i saw was incoporating a full healthy diet. I added up all the calories and i found that i was being malnurished. I was only getting about 1800 calories a day. If i was doing water polo or swimming during this, i don't know waht would have happend to me. I suppose i would have withered away because of the intense exercise and not enough food. I ended up lossing about 5 pounds, but i believe it was in water weight.   LAtely i have been exercising a bunch, getting ready for Philmont, swimming, water polo, and stephie. (she's got to have a some what muscular person) Well i hope she would liek that i am trying to build muscles become leaner, etc. the "buff guy" maybe even the "ripped guy" who knows or i could jsut be andy the swimmer. or just andyswmr. Good stuff .   Right after i print this bad boy blog stuff out, i am goign to julies and help my dad with building her dad's ramp. He had alittle over half his leg amputated. So he's in a wheel chair, cruzin around. good stuff. I always wanted to see what it was like having to rely on a wheel chair. I don't know if i would mind having my legs crippled. I would porbally go into that wheel chair racing stuff. Looks really fun. ANd ur arms get really ripped from rolling yourself around.   Yep oh oh and i got my prom pictures which after we work on julies dad's ramp, i will proceed to stephanie's to show her the pictures and proablly give her most of them. I can't believe i spent 60 bucks on pictures. They turned out pretty good so that worry is gone. But now i just have like a bagillion pictures, and a couple ginormus ones. I think i will have mine framed or somethign of the sort.   Well i need to go turn this in, adios I can't find in teh html the code to change the "contributors" I want to chagne it authors or something else, Because we are not mearly contributors, these are our thoughts ideas whinings lives etc., we deserve a better title tahn "contributors"    Working on it.... stupid titles.... Anyone who wants a link from our page, please tell me and we will see if it is acceptable.  I figured it out. Wow u know html is kinda easy. you need to know the basic commands but like if u set up a item to be a certain size color etc, you can use the same settings for it by using the same tag for it.  I noticed that most of the blog template is a bunch of tags leading from one set to the other. I am pretty sure if i wanted to change the size, color, font. i could it might fry my brain alittle, but i could do it. HA YAY for me, thanks jeff for the assitance that u didn't really give me.   I love stephie I think i figured out what was wrong, and fixed it. Now stephie's name shows up when she blogs and my name shows up when i blog. Um the only things left to do are to add links and change the template. I have to say i am working on learning all of this stuff. test 2 test So its about 12:04 Am. Its just tomororw right about now. I just took a run to burn myself out for sleeping. Today was lots of fun. I finished my sculpture in art and that felt wonderful. Like freedom from art. I am not taking it next year so that makes me happy. I can go create, imagine, design, love, and be happy without getting a grade. This is today which means that I have been going out with Stephanie for 4 months. Great times, I Love Stephanie. I have never felt like this for any other girl. Just soo happy, carefree, lost in love, Nothing can stop me when I am with her. I feel like just wow. I love her.   SO tomorrow is today which means there are three water polo games today and I intend to go to one or more of them. I know that I haven't shown up for any of the other games or any practices which is fine with me, I just hope that they will let me play if I show up. I am listening to this dude's songs. Very good. Completely unexpectedly good. And just very cool.  Kinda weird when I know that this person is kinda close to me, in a way that idk is ok. I am kinda afraid of the future. I don't' like knowing what will happen and what won't. I want to shape my future into what I see and want right now. But that's just not acceptable to HIm. He will direct me in ways unknown, He will guide me, I wish and pray for this girl, I hope He will direct her, and guide her, along her way, close to me, next to me, with me. I hope our paths are entwined to no end. As it was Said by Queeny "God is the ultimate wedding planner" Very good stuff that is. Anyways I best be going. Tomorrow, I mean today is upon us,  !!! I love Stephanie, PALABRA(word) Well my babe, stephanie, is hurt. I don't knwo enough about what happend, and i am worring alot. So its about 1 am so i need to get this stupid homework crap done. I need to tell my bud about this blog so yeah. Palabra(word) Well lets see if this blogger thing will work for me.

I didn't do much else except work and maybe talk to my buddy jeff.   Tonight which was yesterday, tuesday, we went to faust park. Concert very very fun. Good music. Oh and the fireworks were great. IT was great to see stephie     sry i can't blog now to frusterated yay! summer is here! i'sa so HAPPY!  on the last day of school, last friday, andy picked me up from school and we went to see Harry Potter with his little brothers.  Then we went to the Cardinals game- my first baseball game of the season!  It was so much fun and we won!  Andy didn't know too much about baseball which I found funny.  Anyway, then Saturday I went to Emily's bridal shower :) so cute and Andy and I went swimming and Saturday night I went to the mall with Kara to look for stuff for Europe and we went to see Raising Helen which was very good and funny.  Then Sunday I went to church which was so much fun!  And then Jen and I went bike riding at Creve Coure Park AWESOMENESS!  my chain pulled off though so we had to put it back on and get all greasy and oily and yucky :) yay.  Then when I got cleaned up I went to Adam's graduation party which was also fun and then later Andy and I went to see Mean Girls.  Andy's so cute.  He showed up in baggy jeans, this shirt I gave him as a gift, and hiking boots cuz he's getting ready for Philmont.  He looked HOT.  Anyway lol BUSY weekend.  Yesterday I went job hunting and looked places for apps and filled them out and did some interviewing to get a job.  Stephie's growing up lol.  Then once again I went to see Harry Potter with Andy and my parents.  I want to go see it again if I can go to the OmniMax.  Anway, on Friday Kara and I leave for Europe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I can't wait for stephie to get back. oooooooooooooooooook so i haven't posted in mucho time, but here we go.  school ended well, no bad grades and right after i went to europe! europe was awesomeness. i went to london, paris, rome, florence, pisa, and assisi all of which were fantastic.  italy was my favorite i want to go back and live there at some point in time.  after i got back i had to wait a lil while and then andy got back from philmont.  its been fun spending the summer with andy.  hi baby :) lol why do i type this u and i are prolly the only ones who read each others u think?  on july 22nd its our 6 month anniversary and andy is supposed to cook for me.  anyway tommarow i leave for a lil getaway to chicago.  i am excited.  i need to go finish packing though.  i want to go to six flags sometime this summer!  my bday was july 4th and i had  fun one and got to see fireworks o and now i am 17!!!!! yay for me.  the rest of this summer seems to be filled with college visits and church stuff, etc.  school should never come again stay away!  ok bye bye SO this is the first time I have blogged in about a baggillion years. SO I went to philmont, and came home, and started working on my eagle scout project. Lots of stuff has been going on.   The new house's roof is slowly being constructed. They ordered the wrong size of rafters. They were supposed to be 2x6 sizes but they gave us 2x4 sizes. They are stupid and its taking longer to construct.   IF you don't' know I was in a car accident. I am fine. No one else was involved. The car is undrivable at the moment. IT was purely accidental. The car started to hydroplane and we hit the median twice and rolled off the road. Good times...  I can't wait for tonight. WE, stephie and I, are going to the baseball game. It's going to be lots of fun. TO the baseball game.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 29th time. The tested sentence is:  Since KG has gotten older we now can play more outside.  Her grandmother got her a cute little gardening set for Easter and KG loves to play with it.  Of course when she first got it she wound up with a mouthful of dirt, yuck! But over a month has gone by and she hasn't done it again, until the other day.  Why she didn't learn from the first time I do not know.    We went out to dinner last night and everyone smiles at her and wants to say hi.  I'm so glad that she is so friendly.  Even this morning I was getting our car serviced and as we were waiting, a mother and her little girl came in and KG was trying to give her hugs and kisses.  She's such a lovey. Well, this is a first for me...to put my thoughts out where others will read about them.  I wonder if I can handle it? We'll see how it goes.  Stay tuned... For the last few weeks I have been trying to find a suitable bathing suit.  I searched high and low.  The thing is, I knew exactly what I was looking for...I could picture it in my head.  But could I find it? No, of course not.  I settled.  But, it turned out to be a good thing.  Not only did I spend about half the money that I originally was willing to spend but I must say, it looks really nice on me and most of all, it's comfortable.  I'm actually very excited about it.  Mind you, I have not been in a bathing suit in almost 3 years.  See, two years ago I was hugely pregnant with KG and did not want anyone to see me in that condition.  Then, last year I really didn't have any opportunity to go to the beach or to go in someone's pool so I didn't wear one last year either.  So, I'm looking forward to (cautiously) getting some sun and to get that drowsy relaxed feeling of just laying outside and baking for a while.  Of course I'll be slathered up in sunscreen but it will be nice anyway.  Much better than being miserable with a sunburn for the rest of the week! Well, that's where I'm headed pretty soon.  I'm really looking forward to my visit with my Arizona family.  I will get to meet my brand new little niece and I will be able to relax and bask in the beautiful (but hot) sunshine.  I've heard that lately it's been up to 110 degrees.  But, we will live in the pool, or air conditioning so I'm not really worried about it.  Although, I am kind of worried about my husband.  He's not coming with me and KG and I don't know how he will be without seeing his little girl for a whole week.  We'll have to call him a few times a day so that he can hear his KG's voice.  It really is such a sweet voice, really high-pitched but oh so sweet.  Especially when she wakes up from a nap and she's in her crib and she says "UH-OH" several times over and over.  The sweetest sound on earth. Well, the other day it happened, I found out that I am expecting another baby.  I am excited and at the same time kind of scared.  Not scared like with KG, scared in a different way.  I have fears about money, about handling two kids, about not loving another child like I love KG.  When I found out I was pregnant with KG it was a fear of the unknown...what it's like to be pregnant and have all of these strange changes in your body.  Not to mention childbirth, that is something that no matter how much someone describes it to you, you will never know until you've been there.  And I'm excited but it's a different kind of excitement, kind of like a roller coaster ride that you've been on before, it's still exciting but it's kind of like a "been there done that" kind of thing.    Now I said all of that to say this...I am PREGNANT! I cannot wait for this child to develop inside of me and to feel all of the changes as it's body grows.  The first kick, the first hiccup.  I can't believe that I'm here again, being able to enjoy this tiny miracle that is growing inside. Today is such a beautiful day.  Not one drop of humidity and about 75 degrees.  Just gorgeous.  Tomorrow, unfortunately, is supposed to be rainy.  Oh well, at least I have today.    Yesterday I used sunless tanning gel.  I bought a pretty good brand, seeing as how the last time I used a cheaper brand my legs turned orange.  I don't know what I was thinking, to say the least.  The directions say to be careful around your ankles and knees because the skin is thinner and the gel will take differently than the rest of your skin.  I look like an  idiot .  I have a line right above my ankle bone where the tan stops and my very white feet start.  Hopefully it starts to fade by tomorrow because I have a bridal shower to go to and I wanted to wear sandals.  I think I've learned my lesson now, no more sunless tanning products KG went to her first parade yesterday.  She really seemed to enjoy herself.  She was clapping and waving to all of the people in the parade.  It was a wonderful weekend.    We had beautiful weather on Saturday and Sunday.  Rich and I were able to finish up our flower beds and Rich was able to mow the lawn and do yard work.  We are starting to wonder how much work we are going to put into this house before we decide to sell it.  Such a hard decision.  Since we've put in so much hard work we are really starting to enjoy our house.  But we know that it is small and as our family grows (eventually) we will need something bigger.  It's kind of bittersweet.  I really don't want to think about another move yet.  I hate moving, I think in our five years of marriage 3 moves is good enough.  For now.  I may think otherwise when KG wants her own time in our 1 bathroom and when Rich and I can't get any privacy.  We'll have to wait and see. Yesterday my mom and I took KG to the beach.  Unfortunately, my little girl is afraid of the water.  And sand.  She hated the pool when we went to Arizona but I keep on thinking that maybe the next time it will be different.  I can't say that I had high hopes for the beach, but I honestly didn't think that she would be afraid to leave our blanket and put her little feet in the sand.  She didn't break down crying and start shaking like she did at the pool in AZ but she most definitely did not like it.  My mom and I tried several times to bring her down to the water but she wasn't having it.   I guess I'll just keep on trying.  The other little kids there were running in and out of the water and getting sand all over them while they were building sand castles (which I must say looked like a lot of fun).  Hopefully KG will overcome her fear and learn to enjoy the water one of these days. Right now is such a hard time of my pregnancy.  The problem being this...I don't really have a pregnant belly yet but at the same time I'm starting to expand and I don't have clothes that are comfortable  and  look decent to wear in public.  I have resorted to wearing sweats and elastic waist pants whenever I'm home, but what do I wear to work? I have a few things that used to be too big for me that are okay to wear to work but not wonderful.  I just want to get a pregnant belly so that I can wear maternity clothes and people won't look at me wondering  why  I'm wearing maternity clothes.  This morning I had a Dr's appt.  I waited and waited and then I waited some more for the Dr.  Finally, when she came in she used the doppler to find the heartbeat.  She warned me that since I'm only 10+ weeks that we might not be able to hear it yet.  I braced myself, hoping that we would be able to.  After a minute of searching she found it, a beautiful, strong heartbeat.  It was the sweetest sound a mother could ever hear.  We have a dilemna this year.  Do we save money and forego a vacation or do we wing it and go anyway?    I love Cape Cod.  I haven't been in two years and I would really love to go this year.  We would go in September because that's when things quiet down with kids going back to school.  I would love to go for a whole week but it looks like we'll just go for a couple of days.  I guess that's enough.  We're not into going to the beach everyday so even if we go just once that would be enough for me.     I want to go to Rock Harbor, Marconi Beach, Nauset Beach and all of the other places from my youth.  It really is a wonderful place, with interesting history and charm.  I know, I sound like an advertisement but I really do love it there.  KG has found her favorite word...NO! I knew to expect this but I was hoping it wouldn't come this soon.  She has learned that she can try our patience very easily but uttering that tiny little word.  Usually it's in response to something we tell her not to do or to put something down that she shouldn't have, etc.  She will turn 2 years old on August 7th.  I hate the term but I hope she doesn't go through the "terrible twos" stage.  Somehow I was naively hoping that she would skip it, being the angel child that she has been up until now.  Ugh.  As for her 2nd birthday, I have no idea what to do and it's less than a month away.  I guess I should put my thinking cap on and figure something out.  Last year we had two parties for her but that was because my sister got married so family was in town that wouldn't normally.  So, we had a big party with that family because we knew that it would probably be the only birthday they would be here for.  What to do? Yuck, I hate this kind of thing, how about some cake and ice cream? :)Sounds good to me. Well, we are back home now after our trip to Arizona.  We had a wonderful time and I really enjoyed basking in the sun and enjoying the pool.  KG on the other hand, did not.  She despised the pool, even a baby pool that I bought for her.  Don't know what it is exactly, even if you dip her toes in the pool she freaks out.  She starts crying and clinging to you for dear life.  We'll have to work through it slowly to get her to enjoy it.  I felt bad because I was really hoping that she would enjoy it and be able to splash around (while I was catching some rays myself, of course).   We did enjoy spending time with both my Dad and Mum.  And of course, my brothers and sister too.  We were able to meet my new niece, which was most definitely a joy.  She's such a cutie, just 6 weeks old.  It was nice to be pampered and not have to worry about what to make for dinner and all of that kind of stuff.  Rich held up well at home by himself.  Luckily he had a busy week at work so it wasn't like he had a ton of time on his hands.    Today I have to go for some bloodwork (prenatal stuff) which will be delightful.  I remember this from when I was pregnant with KG, it's a ton of vials that they have to draw.  Wonderful!

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 32th time. The tested sentence is:  Beautiful Day in Connecticut, sunny nice breeze and min humidity...gotta love it. Went to my first DCA show of the year last night.  Great night for drum corps.  If you want to see the scores and read the review go to  urlLink Drum Corps discussion Board .  Pool is ready and kids have been swimming every day(Holly and friends that is), Bob is busy with the Hurcs on weekends.  Crosstown Tornadoes will have a table at the upcoming DCI show in New London this Wednesday.  Hope to see alot of people there.  Heard through the grape vine (Sam) that WPDC us having trouble keeping their drum instructor happy.  He was the only other person involved (besides Bob and I) that tried to move the corps foward.  It has been about a year since we left and now it is the drum instructors turn to get blackballed....Hate to say it BUT...we told you so. And not too much has changed.  Last evening was our last practice at Nathan Hale for the year...we will be practicing in Wallingford at Community Park beginning the first week in July.  I will let you know where we will practice for the next couple weeks.  Things continue to not have changed much with the park drum corps...they sent one of their spies old Uncle D to check on us last night...we all decided that since he only sat in the car for a few minutes and then took off, that he could not handle the intensity of the corps drill...they are certainly getting better each week.  The corps will be at the DCI show in New London on June 30th.  We will have a table with corps items and information.  Some of our staff will be checking out the Cadets, as they plan to march with that corps next year...  Well school is out in Meriden tomorrow and within the next few days for most of the kids in our area...if you are not a member of our drum corps and play and instrument (brass or percussion) give us a shout so as you don't lose your chops our the summer... Well it is really warm today and we went from cold and needing the heat over the weekend to real hot and needing the airconditioner.  Well I was right about the competition for Hudson Valley over the weekend, ok so I thought it was CF&DA very similar just alittle less organized...  Same winners, same old songs, who cares...get some new corps, stop the nonsense...or just let them pay for their medals.  Or you could just put names in a hat and draw for who gets the medal...that would be alot more exciting....  Well off to drum corps, and Holly has her class night...  Addendum 9:25pm, nice practice of the Crosstown Tornadoes tonight.  Great marching all.  Remember the more you practice the better you get.  Rock step rules!!  well I got more of the scoop on this past weekends State meet for Hudson valley (which of course is run by all CT people and no one from New York. They really messed up on the judges and scoring.  First they had two different people judging the same category (glocks I know for sure) and the score sheets were all messed up.  Course it doesn't help that all of the board of this association never lifted a finger to help on last years competition so...(I know this as I was the Secretary for this association last year and handled the entire competition myself well with my lap top).  They forgot to subtract for undertime, and so who knows who really won.  Like I said put names in a hat...it is much more accurate...  Here is the other goof...they claim that if you win the state competition and then go on to compete at Northeastern and win then you are a north easter champ...now lets look at this... CF&DA, Hudson Valley, and Mass state are all run by basically the same handful of very narrow minded people.  The only association that in some way has remained pure is the GDACA.  They will not allow any corps not from that area to join as they are in other assoc...go figure sounds like a plan.  The corps that compete in the 3 assoc are all the same... Senior Competition ST Petes.  only one no competition and they have discouraged other competitors...Jr Combination Prospect, WPDC OW and pretty much defunct Westbury.  These corps have black balled any new corps that try to join as they may try and still their members...Senior Ancient There are several but not many that compete as a corps.  And a few Jr Ancient corps.  Now if these state competitions all 3 jur corps compete then each one represents a state... and ST Petes wins by default...How in God's Name can anyone consider these group champions....Give me a break... Oh and atleast one of Hudson Valleys duets and probably more has to be redone next month at an ID&Q in Cromwell because of the mess up in judging.  That is a shame and a disgrace on the association...what did these groups get for the money they paid...probably not even comments  on their performance that is helpful.... On our message board the other day was a question from a member of WPDC asking if the Crosstown Tornadoes would be attending a state competition...It was explained to this member that some of the adult committee members of WPDC along with other committees of other junior corps in this association were afraid the Crosstown Tornadoes were trying to steal their members so they did not want this corps to be part of their association.  What bullcrap is that.  What they are really afraid of is competition from a corps and potentially other corps that may effect change on their stupid traditional ways.  The fact is that their are only 3 junior corps and occasionally one that is nearly defunct that compete at these competitions.  It is a standstill competition and they always play the same songs.  Occasionally a corps will pull one from their ancient files and add something new but basically no changes....One year WPDC's instructors(not the committee or their music director) actually did something inovative and started a new song and added some great drummming and horns lines and actually won the competition with a new rendition of an old song...those instructors are now gone...and they are back to poor to mediocre crap.  It will be fairly predicable who will win this competetion unless the judges are influenced to not place a corps well because of some controvery. Alot of times these corps and individuals compete against noone, just themselves and still win and believe they are champions.  I have to say at one time I believed just that because the junior corps make the kids believe that they are the best and keep them sheltered from all of the other great corps around the world.  If you ask the majority of the members of these drum corps they would not know what DCI is, who the Cadets, Blue Devils, Phantom Regiment, Santa Clara Vanguard and all of the true musicians of the drum corps international are.... My feelings are pretty clear...these junior corps of the CF&DA are jokes, and need to allow further drum corps in to compete to truely be able to improve the musical quality of their members....so take the challenge CF&DA and allow and invite some of these other corps into your competitions then you can truely say you winners.... Check out this article in Drum Corps World about 3 new Corps in Connecticut...two are juniors...come on CF&DA...  urlLink New Corps Article Just sitting here after setting up the pool and doing yard work and was sad to hear that President Ronald Reagan had died at 93.  I am sure it is a sad time for his family but also a time of relief.  He has been sick with alzeheimers disease for so long and it is such a devastating disease for a family.  Atleast his family was with him at the time of his death and he was able to remain at home.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his family. Although it has been a short week, today is Thursday and I keep thinking it is Friday.  Can't wait for the weekend.   Crosstown Tornadoes has added another horn tech, will give you more information soon.  We still need drum techs.  Once we have our guard in place we have a guard tech ready to start...Hoping to add more experienced members to help out those that are just learning.   One of our board of directors is having surgery tomorrow and we wish them well. Crosstown Tornadoes had a great practice.  They worked for quite some time on marching.  It was great when asked who their idols were (to try and envision their idols marching like...) one member said another members mother, and the main idol was Jesus...So they rolled their feet like Jesus would do...They picked it not us... Kelly was awarded the master marcher of the night...Vinny did try and trick the group into believing if they could march perfectly he would give them 60 bucks.  Well, no one got the 60 but Kelly did get $2.00, not bad.  What Bob and Vinny didn't tell the group was that the Hurcs as do most of the corps, work for hours on marching.  And this group did great for the first real working on it... Keep working at it, this corps is young but has great potential, we can hopefully get some more experienced members to help give you all confidence.  On a more personal note, our yard is totally torn up by the town. They are putting in new drainage system for the town.  The great news is that the company digging has agreed to regrade my lawn and new seed, so once they are done it will be awesome.  Course that will probably be quite sometime.  We do have our strawberry plants in the front so we are getting plenty of berries, but the rasberries are pretty much covered by dirt...oh well will replant them next year. The Crosstown Tornadoes did not march in any parades over this weekend.  We were short two snare harnesses (which are on back order along with a snare drum from dynasty) and our uniform alterations had not quite been finished.  This is one of the first Memorial Days that I have not had to march in quite a few years.  It was nice to be able to do what I wanted...Course one of those things was to go to the Ansonia parade. Holly and I went to the parade and found it to be quite fun.  The Hurcs looked and sounded great and of course Mariah and Mag 7 are always crowd pleasures.  They were very nice to us (it helps that Bob and two of our instructors are with the Hurcs).  Holly watched and took some pointers from their major.  Thanks Hurcs for your support. Not surprising there were several fife and drum corps that were not so courteous.  It was nice of one of the members of WPDC to come and talk to us( as we have been members of this corps for many years) but our understanding is he received some really nasty looks and nasty comments.  Sorry, but still glad to see that not all people are butts.  I would say grow up but one of the adult combination corps were equally as rude...so all I can say is get over yourselves. Another band we did notice was the Ansonia Prep Schools band, they were small but the sure looked like they were having a great time.  There drum section was pretty good to... Well here it is on Saturday...thought it was going to be nice...but...so far just rain.   Reviewed recent comments by "Anonymous", and it cracks me up to think they truely believe they are anonymous...I guess just to the average reader they are anonymous...but not to the board admin...or even someone that has any web savy.  Not to mention that just the content of the post gives it away...jealousy, simple, truely moronic post....so stupid I had to delete them...So as I have said in the past on the discussion board, give your name or I will change your post to something I like....like I did for yourself, friends, and parent on the discussion board.... Enough of that...the corps is doing a great job with block marching, and learning to move rapidly across the field. Thanks to the Town of Wallingford for the use of Community Park... Well Happy July.  Last night we all went to the DCI show in New London hosted by the Surfers alumni/7th Regiment.  It was an awesome show...if you want to read the review go to  urlLink Reviews .  We had a great time.  The Tornadoes had a table set up and their were alot of people that came by and said hi and welcomed us.  This whole experience has been great and can't wait to do it again.  The night had a great conclusion when Holly (on behalf of all of us) won the 50/50 raffle which sent us home with nearly $1000, ahead...We did donate $100.00 back to the 7th Regiment and had a great day shopping on our winnings. Hope all will consider going to one of these shows (DCI or DCA better yet go to both)You will have an awesome time.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 33th time. The tested sentence is:  my apologies for the lack in posting lately. My wonderful Dell laptop finally shit. Well, not really, it is just in the shop having the keyboard replaced due to a mishap with a couple of Kendall's last summer: 1. A glass of Kendall Jackson spilled all over the keyboard, and 2. Kendall the dog pissing all over the computer while I was packing for Cali. (I guess I should have taken that as a sign.) Anyway, the keyboard is finally being replaced a year later. you should have seen the dude's face when I told him all that it had been through. later he called me and told me my computer had contracted 4 viruses. that ho. so in the meantime, i am internet-less. which hasn't been that bad. is it me, or is the world of blogging not what it used to be. it used to be fun, and now people are dropping like flies and shit. i don't know. maybe they have all gone on and gotten lives and i am just one sick, sad, sorry, unemployed fuck.  well my gainfully unemployed ass is going to go soak up what is left of the sun. peace. "Yes, you see love is not something that happens to you, it is something you do. So what didn't I do?" ~Bridget Jones, The Edge of Reason  As much as I would love to love someone, I feel I am thoroughly incapable of it right now. I am inventing my own little world, getting into the groove of the single thing. To add another person to my life right now would just mess up my equilibrium. I am drama free, worry free, just free. No wondering, "Is he going to call", and if he does call "what am i going to say!?!" No worries.   Don't get me wrong. There are things that I miss. I mean, I like a penis as much as the next guy, but the hassle and drama that comes along with said appendage is just not worth it to me right now.   While still in it's developmental stages, the master Monkey Butt plan includes no room for another person. If someone comes along and wants to be part of my world for a little while, that is cool. But I am not going to reshape my life for another person ever again. It's just not my style. ;) Number of jobs I've had since returning to New York: 2. Number of jobs I've left since returning to New York: 2. Number of jobs I have right now: 0. Weight lifted off of my shoulders since leaving said jobs: A ton.     I am unemployed. Again. I have had it with the fat Nazi ho that berates me every day, and pokes me in the back to make her point. I don't understand what I have ever done to the bitch, but she was gunning for me big time. I would have been fired anyway, so I am not worried about a reference. I guess I will be working for my dad in the meantime. I just wish I could pinpoint exactly what it is I was meant for. It seems like everyone around me has found their niche, and I just can't seem to settle on one thing.   Well, time to go begin the job search again... Tonight, I had my first taste of yokel, er I mean  local  politics. I figured that since I am probably going to stay in Craphole for a while, I should get involved. Especially since my father owns a large business in the town- a business that one day my brother and I will be running together (that is if we don't kill each other). It is time for me to make a name for myself here, as a force to be reckoned with if any yuppies come in and try to destroy all that my family has built over the years. My brother has no interest in politics, and while he is an intelligent kid, has no sense of diplomacy. If it were left up to him, he would tell you to go fuck yourself, and barricade the place with snipers and surround it with land mines. I, on the other hand, will tell you to go fuck yourself with a smile on my face.  Seriously though. I need these people to understand that I am not just Mr. Monkey Butt's flighty daughter. I am an adult now, and as much as I don't want to accept that, i think it is time to step up, because nobody else is going to.   So the meeting was very brief, and a tad boring, but we came out smelling like roses. It wasn't much of a battle this time, but I plan to continue my presence at the meetings.   I am developing another elaborate scheme for my future, but like the weather here in Craphole, that could change with the day.... so here i am.... moved again. just call me a blogger gypsy. I just felt i needed to start over, stop bitching, snap out of my woe-is- me routine and snap back into my relentlessly evil and vulgar (with a touch of sweetness) self.  ;)  I still have no idea what I want. just when i think i have a plan, I change my mind. and then i want to run- convinced that the answers lie somewhere in a bay sunrise or a bayou breeze. or maybe at the bottom of the margarita bucket. but of course, they don't, and at the risk of sounding like a total cheesy ass cliche, the answers lie in me. I just want to wake up in the morning not knowing what the day will bring. Where a smile can change your world, or silence could break it. I don't want to live vicariously through others- I Want others to live vicariously through me. I want to be surrounded by love and adventure, music and intrigue. I want sunshine, I want to dance. I want simplicity, I want beauty.   Is that too much to ask? I've given myself another clean slate. Stay tuned for more hijinks. I have to go hiking now. "Sorry I'm not home right nowI'm walking into spiderwebs- so leave a message and I'll call you back- a likely story, but leave a message and I'll call you back..." ~no doubt~   Well, all you animal freaks will be happy to know that Merry and Pippin have found homes. Not together, as I had hopes, but they both went to loving homes and are sure to be well cared for. I didn't take them to the shelter, I actually took them to the produce stand and hung out with them all day preying on yuppie sympathy. It worked. I was pretty surprised, as I thought it would take me a few days before someone was interested. In a way I am glad they have found a home, but I couldn't help but feel a little sad when Pippin went. (He was my favorite, and the last to go). In the end though, I am not a cat person. After changing two nasty litter boxes, I remembered the #1 reason I prefer dogs: They do not poop in your house. (Unless you feed them Peanut Butter Scooby snacks, but I digress). But anyway, animals are animals, and I love them all.  I actually am beginning to think that I care for animals more than I do people. It pisses me off to no end that people can be so heartless and throw an animal to the side of the road. To have that little respect for a living creature that didn't ask to be brought in to this world, and is hopeless to defend itself against it's harsh reality. Yeah, I may be a tad over-dramatic, but that's how i feel. Simply put, some people are terds. But Merry and Pippin are now safe, happy, and loved.  Speaking of people being terds, I am not exempt from this generalization. I recieved numerous phone calls yesterday from the married (divorced?) dude from the  urlLink Saratoga trip . We were supposed to go out tonight. I guess I gave him my number. I didn't call him back. so i guess i am a shit by blowing him off. story of my life i guess. i don't know what i was thinking by agreeing to go out with him. i guess the mimosas at 10 am and amstels got to me by 8 pm and my judgement was marred. unfortunately, this probably is not the last I have heard from him. apparently, he is involved with one of my father's projects, so i am sure I have not heard the end of this.... gotta lay low for a while. am i a shit for deleting his messages and not returning his calls? maybe i should have done the mature thing and told him the truth over the phone. i just can't be that mean. it is easier to ignore- isn't it?? In my effort to maintain my fitness, and attempting to burn off some calories from monday's extravaganza, I decided to supplement my morning run with an afternoon power walk.  I got more than I bargained for.  About a mile away from home, Kendall started going nuts, and ran out in the middle of the road. I pulled her back, thinking it was just a squirrel or a deer, which it normally is. I looked over to see what was driving her so insane. It was two small kittens. In the middle of nowhere, on the side of the road.  Once I acknowledged  their presence, they ran across the street towards me. Kendall was licking her chops, thinking they were a snack. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't just leave them there in the middle of the road. So, with Kendall growling and leaping around like a kangaroo, I scooped them into my arms and headed for home. It was rather difficult to juggle two small kittens in my arms and keep Kendall from devouring them, but I made it home with my new little friends. I know I can't keep them, as much as I want to. It sickens me to think of how or why they ended up there, on the side of a country road. But I'd like to think that I was meant to walk that way today, and I was meant to find little Merry and Pippin. (yeah, I am a dork.)  Not the question remains- what to do with them. It is clear that with Kendall, having a cat (let alone 2) Is not a possibility. Not to mention the fact that my mom's landlord looked less than thrilled when I came home with my new little friends. The animal shelter was not open by the time I got back. Part of me wants to take them down there tomorrow morning, but my dad suggested that I try to give them away at the farm this weekend. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to get too attached. A lot of it also depends how kendall handles the rest of the evening.  I must be an animal magnet or something. Two or three years ago, I stumbled across a kitten in a hotel room in Meridian, Mississippi on my way to New Orleans. I hope Mississippi Frodo is doing well....  Ok, I am going to go check on the little ones.... rock on. And if you are a local and know anyone who wants a kitten, e mail me or leave a comment. I am never drinking again. I have to remember that I am back in NY. Worse than that, I am back in the place where everyone knows me- where I have many enemies, and very few friends. throwing alcohol into the mix only complicates matters. At the time it seemed like a good idea, but in retrospect, I should never have gotten on that bus.  I went to the  urlLink track  yesterday.  It was a bus trip with the local bar, with free food and alcohol all day. I thought it would be cool to go with my father and bond, and try to make some $$. He ended up trying to pawn me off on one of his married friends. The dude was a nice enough guy, but 1. he is married, 2. he is 11 years older than me, and 3. he was not terribly attractive.  Then, who steps on the bus but this asshole that i punched in the face at a concert last summer.  At that point i knew it would be a bad day. We successfully avoided any altercation, but we weren't exactly civil to one another.  All in all, the day wasn't that bad. I lost $20, and ended up giving out my phone # to way too many people. I think my dad is pissed at me for running m mouth about something- only bits and pieces of the day have been filtering back into my mind. I think I agreed to go on a date with the married guy. Maybe he will lose my number or forget to call. Keep your fingers crossed.  Yesterday reminded me again why I left this area in the first place. I didn't want to become one of them. I didn't want to become a townie. I have come to the conclusion that even though I am back, I don'y have to end up like these people. I am going to distance myself from that whole scene- pretend like I never came back. It might be difficult. I think I'll have to get a new cell phone-   In other YAY news- I have my computer back. It is virus, wine, and pee free. I can actually use the keyboard. Oh yeah, and I am no longer unemployed!! I will be starting my  urlLink new job  on monday. I am uber psyched. I'm thinking this place will (hopefully) pan out better than the last two crap jobs I had.  Well thats enough for now....

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 34th time. The tested sentence is:  We went strawberry picking yesterday at this farm called Rae's near Brittania and Trafalgar. It was a different experience...first it's an organic farm (no pesticides!) so there were a lot of weeds growing everywhere around the strawberry plants. I think I'm used to the neat little rows most farms grow their produce in. Second, there was a really mean old lady! She yelled at Vivian and Alex right at the beginning because according to her, they weren't supposed to be in the area -- we were supposed to stay in the area we were assigned to. What kind of stupidness is that? If there aren't any strawberries in one area we move on to the next until we find some! I didn't even know we were "assigned" an area. Both Vivian and Alex were quite annoyed (well, pissed actually) with her.   I got yelled at too. I sort of wandered off on my own and then when I tried to go back to where everyone else was, that stupid lady asked me (in a not very nice manner) where I was going. Hello it's just a strawberry patch! I think she was senile.    urlLink    me in an overgrown strawberry field I can't believe it but I've started to watch anime on YTV again! Every Friday night at 10 pm I'm like, omg I have to watch Inu-Yasha!! haha I'm so weird. But it's my brother's fault! He never stopped watching cartoons on tv and I don't think he'll ever stop. The show is done in the style of Sailor Moon...with the big eyes and the long legs. I'm not sure what the style is called officially. So this totally reminds me of when I used to watch Sailor Moon when I was in high school. It used to be on at 12 noon everyday (I can't believe I still remember that) and I still have the Sailor Moon stickers and a poster somewhere. I have a Sailor Moon sticker on my flute case too!! hehe. I never play my flute anymore...and my dad bugs me about it sometimes. But that's another story. That goes along with the piano that sits in the living room that never gets played :p  So from Sailor Moon I got hooked on Dragon Ball. Then it was Macross Plus (which I still really like). Then a bunch of anime films I don't remember the names to. Oh yeah and Pokemon and Digimon!! HAHAHA...I actually have a HUGE pikachu plush toy that doubles as a pillow that Vivian gave me. Escaflowne is one of my favourites too. haha good times, good times... Things are so different at York now! First there are the nice signs they have for the buildings and also for the street names. New buildings everywhere (the Technology and Enhanced Learning Building is so cool and there's Tim Hortons and other food in there! Right behind CFA!! I'm always happy when the food is closer...)  And they used a super big tent for convocation this year. It was fun! Young and I went uninvited to the convo because ADAM didn't invite us... :p Teresa was supposed to convocate too but she couldn't get off work (flaky Teresa!). The grads started coming in the tent and we didn't see Adam...we thought, "omg what if Adam didn't come??" haha but he was there and it wasn't actually too boring. Jazz great Dave Brubeck performed 2 numbers with his son -- it was really good. I didn't even know who he was but apparently he's pretty famous :D   The food after wasn't as good as last year though! We had fruit, cake, different little desserts and cookies. This year there was only cake and cupcakes. Oh, and sandwiches with cream cheese and cucumber and others with tuna. The sandwiches were pretty good. But the big thing is...THERE ARE NO MORE SAMOSA HATS!! What the... Maybe people complained about them too much so they decided not to use them anymore. But they were fun. It's part of the York experience!    "If you can hold a fork, you can go to York!"    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    1. where are the samosa hats? 2. young and adam: pimpin' 3. uh oh...grafitti on the nice signs already?? I got a pineapple! Well, I got it last week from Garvey for convocation. There's a funny story behind it actually...he was going to get me flowers or a plant but I told him last time that he gave me too many so then he saw the pineapple and thought, "oh this is almost the same" so he picked it up and bought it. He can probably tell you a better story since my stories tend to ramble and people never know when they end. It's sort of like this story I'm telling.... haha  In the pic I look kind of dopey and Garvey looks like he just woke up (he's been busy with school...stuck in the comp animation lab rigging his characters with I-K switches and other stuff I don't understand...). Oh, and we're in a Japanese restaurant with my family.  The pineapple was really good! yum...   urlLink    garvey, me and a pineapple Yes, I went to lunch at Mandarin! haha...it wasn't too bad -- it was only $8.99! I went with Garvey and his animation friends and I made Garvey eat a sweet and sour chicken ball. I have a thing against chicken balls. When I was young, one of my family friend's uncles owned a Chinese fast food place and we hung out there sometimes and helped out with folding boxes etc. We played games and the loser would get the ultimate punishment: they had to eat a CHICKEN BALL. Ok, so it's not the ultimate punishment but chicken balls are so absurd. It's this little piece of chicken surrounded by tons of batter. So really you're getting a mouthful of batter. And it's not real Chinese food!  (I just realized I advertised for Mandarin. :s )  Anyway, for dessert I got different flavours of ice cream in one bowl with M&M sprinkles. I put it down on the table and went out to get some cake and fruit. When I came back, half of my ice cream was gone and it was mushed up!! Garvey blamed it on one of his friends but it didn't work. Thanks Garvey! :p I forgot to bring a camera for my convocation this year for Sheridan! So instead here's a picture from my convocation at York. Look at the funny hats! They're also known as jester hats or "samosa hats" (I don't know who made up that one...but it was probably Teresa). I don't know why but all our eyes are closed except for Helen's. She missed out!   urlLink    Convocation at York 2003 Helen, me, Garvey, Young and Carman My first blog! I had to ask Garvey to give me a nickname for my blog because I suck at it. I sat here for about 15 minutes thinking about a name...and I came up with the most boring names! Isn't that kind of retarded since I'm supposed to be creative person? It's like the plush toys I have which I name after what type of animal they are. There's Moose, Monkey, Brown Bear, Polar Bear....and a whole bunch of other ones. I think my brother and my sister influenced me. They name their stuffed toys the same way too!   I think Young will object to my Blog name since he loves pandas so much (it's an obsession!) He and Teresa are the best at coming up with nicknames. They made up the silliest nicknames for us in first year: Teresa was OmegaMoolahOne. She still uses it too! Mine was Mystifier because I get confused a lot (yeah I know that doesn't make sense). Young thought it was "Demystifier" for the longest time....I don't know why. Finally I said, "It's Mystifier!" It's ok though, it's not like we called each other with the nicknames a lot. :p urlLink     I don't remember who made it, but it was part of a student mural contest. I believe it's actually a series of photographs printed on canvas. So it's almost like a painting. It certainly is very painterly. I miss CFA... This always happens whenever relatives come over to visit -- we go out to eat. A lot. My aunt from New York is visiting this week. She's my dad's cousin (I think) and we call her "Biu Goo." So, today we went for dim sum in Chinatown at that restaurant on Spadina that's supposedly haunted. It was pretty good. Then for dinner we went to ANOTHER Chinese restaurant. At the end of the meal, they started fighting over the bill as Chinese people always do. Sometimes, this gets very loud and people start snatching the bill away to try to pay for it. Stealing the bill and hiding it from the other people is not uncommon. When the time comes to pay for the meal, they magically present the bill to the waiter while everyone else protests. People have also been known to sneak away and take the bill straight to the cash register to pay for it while everyone else is occupied with conversation. That method is probably the funniest one.   When I was little, I thought it was the most embarrassing thing when my parents and the other people got into the whole bill "fight". Sometimes it would last for 10 minutes!! I'm not kidding either. After a while, it started to become amusing. I think the waiters enjoy it too. I had one and a half glasses of beer...probably the most beer I've ever had! It got grosser the more I drank. But that's all I needed to get REALLY RED. Fortunately I didn't feel like passing out...although, I began feeling woozy when I went to the washroom -- so I got out of there quickly. Or at least I tried to! The lady inside the washroom turned on the tap when I came out of the stall, then she gave me soap, AND she gave me paper towel! The whole time I'm thinking, she better stop giving me stuff, I'm not going to tip her! Those washroom people are annoying.  Here's some pics:   urlLink    urlLink Awww...no mo-gee-toes.... we'll make them next time! Now we have a bottle of creme de cassis! We'll make some cocktails. The sangria was good. :) I had an annoying time this morning when I tried to look up the recipe for mojitos. And the reason is because I spelled it as "mohitos"! I'm so dumb. So I finally got the recipe but then my sister and I began debating about whether or not we should make mojitos or sangria tomorrow. It was like,   "Mojitos?"  "Yeah."  "Wait, no, sangria." "Ok." "But we have that bottle of rum from Helen!" "Ok fine, mojitos."  Later: "No, but wouldn't it be better if we made a pitcher of something rather than individual servings?" "Ok, sangria then." "Ok, I know! We make sangria then when that runs out we can make mojitos!" "Ok, fine. Stop talking about it."  And this whole time I kept on spelling mojitos with an "h". Mo-gee-toes. Mo-hee-toes. Apparently no one reads my blog anymore except Garvey and my sister. Actually I don't even know if Garvey has time since he's in Oakville trying to do textures in Photoshop with a Wacom tablet that's not fully functioning.   The good thing is...my bday is coming up!! woohoo!    Bad thing:  colour balancing in Photoshop is so annoying!  Good thing:  I applied to a job today!  Bad thing:  Woolfitt is going away for 1 1/2 months so I have no work to do!  Good thing:  I got paid by Woolfitt today. Yeah $15/h!  Bad thing:  I'm still at Walmart. :(  Good thing:  I tricked the TTC and I stopped over and bought something at Loomis and then went on the streetcar with the same transfer! hehe  ok that's it. I have no more. Well, I'm tired.
+++++ THE GENDER: MALE equals to: FEMALE
ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 35th time. The tested sentence is:  Well here we are in the great state of Oklahoma! Quaide and I got here Saturday night and yesterday we went to our home church to see all of our friends. Everyone was so excited to see us and very warm and welcoming. Being Father's Day, after church we headed to my sisters house for lunch and a nap before heading back to church for the evening service. Man, this reminds me how fast pace our lives used to be when we lived here. We're just sliding right back into the pace of things. Today we don't have anything planned, just hanging out with my Mom and doing some running around. Quaide hasn't had much of an appetite so right now he's munching on some strawberries. They definitely are not as good as Oregon's but let me tell you about the watermelon we had yesterday....it was sooo good!  Last night we had such a HUGE thunder and lightning storm. It was kinda scary as I am out of experience with these. It kept me up most of the night and Quaide came toddling in to my room right before it started and then preceded to sleep through it. I was thankful for that. The wind was blowing so hard and the rain was pelting the windows, it fell like it was going to break them. But I finally fell asleep, only to be awoken by the cat howling in the back yard and the alarm beeping as my dad went outside to tend to it. Mom and Dad's new house is beautiful. It's still kind of weird for me, it's all of their stuff but just doesn't feel quite like home yet. I'm sure it will be a different story in a few days. Everything's so new and clean, I don't want Quaide to mess anything up. Well, I need to get going, I've got a birthday party to plan! Today was a beautiful and busy day. We started out by going to Mt.Tabor Park and meeting some new friends. Danielle and her son Jack, Amy and her daughter Elliott, and another mother and her son whom I cannot remember their names for the life of me. They both had unusual names and I couldn't even remember them to say goodbye with but I hope we see them all again after we get back from our trip to Oklahoma. Quaide had such a great time being around other children. Danielle and Jack met us for lunch at Peanut Butter and Ellies and although the wait was ridiculous (though completely normal for this place)the boys enjoyed playing together on the train and coloring on the walls with the chalk. I took some of Quaide's baby clothes over to Zanzibar Consignment Store which is two doors down, trying to get some extra cash for our upcoming week. It was so hard letting go of some of his precious little outfits. Anyway, on the way home Quaide fell asleep and slept all the way through me carrying him upstairs to his bedroom. After his nap, we went to Target to buy him a little cheapo plastic swimming pool. I wanted something for him to cool off in as it will be getting up to 90 degrees in the next 2-3 days. We don't have air conditioning which is pretty normal here in Oregon but with us having our rooms in the attic area, it gets really hot, really fast. Oklahoma is going to be much hotter but as long as I have air conditioning, I can survive. urlLink    Isn't this a beautiful picture? I just love it! Hagg Lake 6-13-04  urlLink urlLink    We went fishing at Hagg Lake today. Despite the cool temperature and the wind, and the fact that none of us caught a single fish, we had a pretty decent time. 6-13-04  urlLink urlLink    The Parade has passed by and he is all tuckered out, but he has made sure to secure the balloon from flying out the window before drifting of to dreamland!  urlLink urlLink    This, of course, was Quaide's favorite float. He is really into crocodiles lately. He says "Crikey it's a Croc!"- like the Crocodile Hunter!  urlLink urlLink    Had a great time at the Portland Rose Festival Parade this morning. It amazed me how there were people who literally pitched a tent and camped out to get a good seat. We showed up about 20 minutes late and were able to stand pretty close. Good times...good times!  urlLink I have to write this down before I forget. Morning times truely are some of the best times with Quaide. It's a clean slate and he's usually so sweet and has his dreams fresh in his mind. So, I always pick his brain to see what he comes up with. This morning he started to tell me a story and this is how it went: "The little baby shark said, 'Where's my Mommy?' and the Daddy Shark said, 'Shhh. She's laying down taking a nap.' and the baby shark said (in the sweetest, high voice)'Okay, are we going to cool (school) today?' and daddy shark said 'Yes, we are all going to cool.' and then they went to cool all day long."  I told him what a wonderful story that was and thanks for telling it to me. He was so proud of his accomplishment. In hindsight now, I think this sounds somewhat like "Finding Nemo" although he hasn't watched it in a while. Ya just never know...  Oh! Last night as I was reading him his bedtime stories, we were reading Dr. Seuss' ABC Book (Ya know, Big A, Little A, what begins with A?), anyway at the very very last page on the back cover of the book it has the entire alphabet with upper and lowercases kind of in order but not in straight lines, so Quaide wanted me to ask him to point out letters. So I did the ones I knew I had tought him, as stated in an earlier post: A,D,E,I,M,O,Q,U,and X and then he said "Which one other ones?" So I asked him and he knew the N,S,and the T as well. He said t-t-t-t Tad! He has a LeapFrog video that teaches him the letters as well and it just always amazes me when he knows these things that I know I didn't teach him. He's just a sponge right now. It's great!  We are off to the Portland Rose Festival Parade this morning, can't wait. I'm sure I'll have pictures to follow... urlLink    Mother's Day 2004 Notice the rainboots that he didn't take off for like an entire week!  urlLink My silly, silly son came into my room first thing this morning talking about marching bands and how his "Most Favoritest" is a drumbone. Meaning, trombone. Then he said, "No, a clareteck." (clarinet) He is really interested in instruments lately, I can't wait to get him into some kind of lessons when he's a little bit older. I think he'll be very good at it, he's so musical. When I play the piano, he likes to count the beats with me. I've taught him how to count in 4/4. Anyway... he is really athletic as well but there's a slight problem. He has his mothers gracefullness! I'm serious, he'll come running in the room (just like this morning) yelling about something and all you see is his big eyes as he falls to the ground. He doesn't need anything but his own feet to trip on. It's just like the movies- I always seem to see it in slow motion. And he doesn't cry or anything, he's so used to it, he just picks himself back up and continues what he was saying. It's quite hilarious actually. My silly, silly boy! urlLink    Quaide's new "Do". I decided to buzz it all off. Not even two weeks later and it's already grown alot. May 30, 2004  urlLink urlLink    Who else can say they played in the snow on Memorial Day Weekend? That's Oregon for ya. Mt. Hood 2004  urlLink urlLink    This is us...one big happy family. Don't mind the goofy kid in the middle, Quaide's not exactly photogenic  urlLink Well, I am constantly saying that I need to start something like this for the future of our family. I feel so ashamed that I have not journaled more of Quaide's life over the past almost 3 years. Three Years! I can't believe he'll be turning 3 next month. Time does go by so quickly. Yes, yes, I do scrapbook but it's mainly just to preserve my photos, I haven't even done much journaling on it! I don't think I know exactly when Quaide took his first steps or quit breastfeeding, I do know that it happened around the same time. When he was about 10-11 months old. I don't know the day he got his first teeth or any after for that matter. I think it was also around 10 months. Am I a horrible mother for not knowing that? He has really been maturing lately. He pretty much carries on full conversations with us now. Us being, myself, his Daddy, Grammy, and Papa Ron. We are all living together here in Portland. We are really missing family and friends in Oklahoma and my brother and his family who just moved to Alabama. Thus the name: Oregonoklabama. Anyway, Quaide talks so well. He told the lady at the store just today that she was "Delicious" although he doesn't know what that means. It reminded me of when his cousin, Zane, used to do the same thing, trying to impress people with his vocabulary. The funniest thing Quaide says lately is.. Coffee Cup. Yes, that's right, Coffee Cup. I have no earthly idea why or where he gets this from, I think he just likes the way it rolls of his tongue. Out of no where he'll just say, "Coffee Cup". It cracks us up. Which brings me to another favored saying of his "You're cracking me up"- he gets this from his Papa Ron. Which brings me to yet another: "You're killing me"- we don't like that so we don't encourage it. Let's see, what are his major accomplishments as of late? He can count to pretty much anything as long as I prompt him on the 10's. He can get to 20 all by himself. And he can count to 10 in Spanish. He started writing his name about a week ago. It's really amazing how good he is at it. He knows Q,U,A,I,D,E,O,M,S,T, and X(for xylophone he says). He knows all of his shapes and just today at lunchtime, he learned how to draw a person using the triangle for the body, a circle for the head and attatching arms and legs. He was so proud of himself. I had a moment of pride myself as I realized it was his first recognizable picture. And do you know what I did with his first ever drawing? I left it at the restaurant, didn't even think twice about it...Until now! Dumb me. Let's see... He also knows lots and lots of Sign Language, although he doesn't use it anymore unless we ask him to. I really wish there was something I could do to make him keep that, it's just kind of useless right now. He has known all of his colors for some time. He loves coloring, also gluing and cutting with scissors. He's pretty good at cutting- a lady at a church we visited said he's "advanced" for his age. Yep, huff-huff, that's my boy! Anyway, I'm gonna move on and see what all else this blog thingy has, I think it'll be fun! ~Ali I have been getting stricter on Quaide about going on the potty. He's just sooo content with going in his diaper! Ughh! He does pretty well with peeing on it (that is, when I prompt him to) but he's never once went poo-poo on it. I'm really hoping that he's completely potty trained before he starts kindergarten! Haha. Quaide is recognizing all of the letters in the alphabet. His favorite thing to do lately is say all of the letters on our shirts or whatever else has lots of letters for him to read. I'm thinking he'll be reading some by the end of the year! He's so smart and I just pray that Trey and I can keep up with his capacity for knowledge. Quaide's been doing somewhat  better with minding us. After our 3 week trip to Oklahoma, he came home a little more spoiled than when we left. :) He's slowly learning... Having problems uploading pictures so none this time. We are finally home from our whirlwind visit to Oklahoma. 3 weeks still just wasn't enough time to visit with everyone that I wanted to. Quaide was so excited to be around all of his old buddies and now that we are back, I anticipate him having withdrawals. It helped that we were able to see his new friend, Jack, today. It's been sooo hot here today that it feels a little like home except without air conditioning. What is up with that??? Apparently, nobody has a/c around here. They say you don't really need it or something crazy like that but I say, it's worth it even if it is for just a couple of months a year. Why torture yourself for the sake of saving a few extra bucks??? Anyway, tomorrow my baby turns 3. Yes, 3 years old! I can't believe it. He still isn't minding me any better.... I'm waiting for that day to come. A lady at the ball field told me tonight that he'll get better when he's 5. Man, can I wait that long? Guess I don't have a choice. He ran away from me and Trey as we were going back to the car- he ran right to the play structure after we specifically told him to stay by us. He doesn't care what we say, he dances to the beat of his own drum as they say. His punishment was no toys or anything when we got home. He went straight to the bath and then straight to bed. He didn't seem to even notice. Ughhh!!! I love him though and tomorrow I too celebrate the birth of my own motherhood. I am so blessed to be his mommy.

I was so called studying till the sun  urlLink rise.@1st  my notes wen smooth till i realised that PRINCE was quiet all the while. I was astonished & search him here &amp; there. Gladly to know that he was alright, sleeping peacfully behind the cupboard. Since then, i woke him & he simply cant resist of nt disturbing a single sec. I managed to do 7 essays. 7 seems abit tho to me coz i started doin it after watching  CITY OF ANGEL.           Nothing much happened to me, as planned we went out to PASIR RIS to buy all the important things for prince. You know things like, DRY FOOD, games &amp; bathing accessories.

He already hurt my feelings in the train by saying my compre is SUCK......right!!!!But i remain silent.....I know iam nt as clever as him but still i got feeling &amp; i took it as tho its nothing....i took it as a joke......whatever!!!!     ------------------ WHAT A NIGHT------------------ Dear Diary,          My day was ok,nothing much happened!went to pick my CUTE PRINCE from boarding pet & zoommmm back home. Well,i &amp; razali are supposed to go out, but judging by the tym we decided to chill at home since we are waiting for our NEW TV SET & razali is working nite shift. Why does he have to work nite shift??          Yesterday, was a miraculios day. Why i said so coz things wen the way i so called want it to be. First & formost, i &amp; razali had a crucial conversation with his parents regarding abt his  STUDY   &   COMMITMENT.           Everyone is concern abt his study. He is really a WITTY guy you noe. I mean he's brilliant, smart & HANDSOME...hahah. well, actually he's supposed to further his studies last yr. He got a plc in Aussie Uni-- QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY--i hav no idea to why he decided to get married instead but alhamdulillah now his dreams is coming true. He's taking his PT degree in AEROSPACE ENGINEERING &amp; his final yr he will hav to be a   FULL TIME STUDENT in UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY OF SYDNEY.  It's a state UNI. Looks like i will hav to remain intact here if i were to join NIE next yr.           Other than that, we discussed abt HOUSE.oh yah, iam quite sad to release  DUXTON HSE   but we already set our mind nt stayin here that long either. Once razali graduated frm sydney, he will try to get a job thru the attachment company & started working while i be in spore studying as well. Once he's stable he will pay for my BOND with MOE.           I think everything went on smooth,alhamdulillah. Abah will pay half of $4,000 for 2 semester & the remaining which are 2 sem will be fullied paid by us. Studying in Aussie, looks like mama &amp; abah will pay for razali. I will help him with any needs he seek for in sydney later on.          Thanks allah for making everything goes smooth &amp; normal. I hope we can go thru all the hurdles that u shall give us Amin.....

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 37th time. The tested sentence is:  Well, it's almost that time of year again.  Time to start thinking about my appartment, and if I'm ready to invest in a more permanent home.  The idea of a house isn't something that interests me, however, a condo sounds more my speed.  Luckily, my sister is a real estate broker, so I don't have to worry about that part of it.  However, it's making the decision of which condos to look at?    A couple friends own condos up on the North-side, and I've pretty much lived on the North-side since moving here after college.  But, there's the lure of Broadripple ( urlLink think Monon Trail ) and  urlLink Eagle Creek Park  area.  UGH!!  I just can't decide. I think I'm addicted to shopping.  Sure, have a good laugh, but I love to go shopping.  I don't always have to buy something, but it's the attraction to new clothes.  I blame this addiction on the pound or two that I've lost.  Ok, closer to 80 lbs, but, my point is, I LOVE TO BUY NEW CLOTHES, and I am no longer restricted to buying Plus Size Clothes!    Now, there's another reason behind this shopping addiction, as is outlined very nicely by  Prof. Ruth Engs, RN, EdD, of the Indiana University, Department of Applied Health Science,  urlLink  she writes:    "Shopping and spending will not assure more love, bolster self-esteem, or heal the hurts, regrets, stress, and the problems of daily living."  Wow.. is that hitting the nail on the head, especially the part about love and self-esteem.   Because of various events in my life, such as divorce, a change of jobs, and failed friendships, I do spend a lot of time alone.  However, I'm really going to try and start connecting with people.  How am I going to do this, well, I have no clue yet, especially, because I do tend to be shy around new people.  So, if you have any suggestions, please let me know.  For starters, I'll use this blog to at least organize my thoughts, and try to start connecting with something or someone besides the mall. Today was a great day.  Earlier, I completed the Indianapolis Sprint Triathlon.  ( urlLink Click here for the full details of the Triathlon ) Then, I finally got to the theatre to see  urlLink Harry Potter .  (Loved the movie.. I can't wait for the next one)  Saw the  urlLink Spiderman 2 trailer  It looks great!!!    Finally, as a reward for all my hard work at training for the Triathlon, I went to a restaurant for a well deserved pizza dinner.  Imagine my surprise to see a clown there performing.    What a great day!!! Follow this link to see some pictures of my nephews, summer-time fun, Bogie cat and other photos...  There are only a few available now, but I'll be adding more soon!   urlLink Lori's Pics Saturday the 26th, is the Indianapolis Sprint Triathlon.  Last year I was to participate in this event, but if you remember, just a couple weeks before the event I severely injured my ankle.  Well, my ankle is all healed, and I've been training like crazy.  I'm so excited.. I just can't wait!    If you're interested in the event, you can learn more at the  urlLink Tuxedo Brothers  Website.    The event consists of a 500 Meter Swim, 10 Mile Bike, 3 Mile Run. Yesterday at work, some co-workers rescued an abandoned kitty.  They brought him into work, and he was immediately adopted by a fellow co-worker.  Now named "Yugi", he went to the vet last night, and is adjusting well to his new home.  He has lots of food and water and a happy home.  Sometimes, things just work out well, and make you smile! Welcome to Kitty Purr!  What's with the name you ask?  Well, I wanted something original and something that would make me smile...and I just love the sound of a kitty cat purring. So, KittyPurr seemed like an obvious choice. Rather than waiting until year-end, I thought I'd come up with a list of goals to work on thru the rest of the year.  Here we go:  1.  Quit trying to give-up Diet Coke.  I'm just going to accept that I need my diet cokes.    2.  Quit being nice to people who truly do not deserve my kindness.    3.  Meet the weight loss goal that Monica set for me by year end.    4.  Enjoy time spent with friends and family, without worrying about other things/chores that need done.  Just relax a little.    5.  more to come soon..... Yes, I can cook, and quite well I've been told, it's just that I don't seem to enjoy it like some of my friends and family do.  However, to recognize each of them for all their hard work, I am providing you with this list of some of my favorite foods often prepared by family and friends.       Mom (Sandy)  - The Next Best Thing to Robert Redford, Potato Salad, and Lasagna   Sister (Debbie) - Enchiladas and Sweedish Meatballs   Grandma Opal - Baked Spaghetti (with Bacon) and Ham &amp; Beans with Cornbread    Grandma Izzy - Homemade Noodles     Aunt Judi - Peanut Butter Fudge and Chocolate Covered Pretzles    Shelly (Cousin) - Italian Sausage Lasagna    Julie - Spinach Pizza (even the crust is homemade) and Chocolate Brownies    Monica - Couscous and Black Bean Roll-ups   Erin - Chicken Parmesan and Stuffed Mushrooms   Ex-boyfriends (to remain nameless) - Kugel and Pierogi's    If I neglected to include your speciality, let me know :-)  Also, if you feel like cooking me a meal.. let me know!   LOL Do you ever wonder what your cat might be thinking? Well, Bob The Ocicat, has his own blog. It's filled with insights into his curious kitty mind. Check it out at   urlLink http://bob_the_ocicat.blogspot.com/    urlLink Bogie  visits the blog regularly, and thought of creating a blog on his own.  However, he realized it might drastically cut into his napping time. Over the weekend, I volunteered at a triathlon organized by  urlLink Tuxedo Brothers .  Why did I volunteer instead of participate?  Well, a minor back injury slowed me down for a couple weeks, and I decided it was time for me to start giving back to society, and this was the first thing I could think of doing as a volunteer.  The event was tons o' fun and  I met some very nice people and cheered on the participants.      In case you haven't heard the other big news, I'm starting a new job on July 26th.  I'm certainly going to miss having fun at work with  urlLink Matt ,  urlLink Seth , and  urlLink Henrik .  While the lure of a new job is exciting, I'll be honest and say that it's a little intimidating to start over again.      Finally, I solemnly pledge that before the end of the month, I'm going to make a quick stop at the car wash and vacuum out my little   urlLink  Corolla   .  The floor has gotten a tad bit dirty.. and she just isn't happy. Lately, on my drives to work or to the mall, I've noticed a few strange things happening.  For example, on monrning on my way to work, I noticed a gentleman in a  urlLink red convertible  moving around his car as if struggling to get comfortable.  It turns out, he was reaching down to put on his socks.  Luckily this was at a rather llloooonnnnngggg stoplight on the northside, so he had plenty of time to finish his task.  This morning, at my favorite bagel shop,  urlLink Einstein Bros  I noticed that the driver in the parking spot next to me was painting her fingernails.  Luckily the car was parked, so no harm-no foul.   Wonder what I'll spot next??? It's the family curse.  As a kid, I remember how my mom's  urlLink Sciatic Nerve  would ache after some type of "incident". By incident, I mean a car wreck, a slip on the ice, moving something very heavy, etc.  Sometimes she'd need medical treatment but most of the time she would "tough" it out.    Well, in my over over-zealousness to workout and get in better shape, I've aggrivated my Sciatic nerve.  During a cool down after a tough 1 hour class, I was doing a  urlLink Cobra Yoga Pose .  It's a very simple move, and as you follow the link above, you'll see that it clearly states " Yoga exercise has no competition element".  Of course, during class, I was thinking....Wow.. I am so much more flexible than everyone else.  Woo Hoo.. I ROCK!    It has now been a couple days since the class, and my lower back is very sore.  I'm icing my back, elevating my legs, and taking ibuprofen.  The next time I'm in class, I'm not going to look around and see if I can stretch further than the others.  I need to listen to Monica (follow the workouts she's given me, and keep my food journal) and I'll succeed at losing the last 30lbs that I'm aiming to loose by year end.  Trying to "out-do" others isn't the way.... Ahhh.. movie quotes.    After taking a very quick poll, I've learned that my friends like:   Just when I thought that I was out they pull me back in. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Get busy living....or get busy dying.    What's your favorite movie quote??? urlLink Turn your sound up and follow this link for online Fireworks! That's right... July 3 - 25 is the Tour De France.  Lance goes for 6!!   Check out  urlLink OLN's  website for updates, and live streaming audio. Yesterday, was the  urlLink Cicero Triathlon .  Unfortunately due to an algae issue in the water, the swim portion of the event was replaced by a 1.7 mile run.  Now, as many of you know, I'm a great swimmer, so I was sad to learn that the swim portion wouldn't take place.   I started out with a nice paced jog and finished the initial run all the while wishing we had been swimming.  Then it was onto the cycling portion, which I consider my second strongest portion, with swimming being my first.  I caught many of those speedy runners during the cycling portion, only to be passed by them again during the final 3 mile run.   While the day was a little disapointing becasue I didn't finish as well as I would have had the swim portion taken place, I am proud of myself for "toughing" it out and finishing strong.   I'm certainly looking forward to next years event... Bring on the Swim!!!!  :-) Recently, I picked up a copy of a magazine and noticed an article about a Pathalogical Giver. That's right, someone who gives and gives and gives. The article, in  urlLink Real Simple  magazine, told the story of a woman who was always giving, in the hopes that people would like her in return.  I noticed some strong similarities between this woman and myself. I realize that in the past, I've gone out of my way to be nice to people and/or do things for them in the hopes that they would like me or "include" me in their lives. AND... this isn't the first I've noticed this trait in myself, as is evidenced by my mid-years resolutions.  I'm tired of trying to get people to like me! If you like me, GREAT... You'll see that I'm a wonderful person. If you don't like me..... well, it's your loss!   :-) Ugh!  I've been having feeling "blah" and had an upset stomach for last six days. I owe a huge thank you to the following people (listed alphabetically) for helping take care of me in various ways.  Belinda, Benny, Bogie, Cody, Debbie, Erin, James, Julie, Kerry, Kyle, Matt, Mom, Patti, and Seth.    You are all wonderful people and I realize how lucky I am to have such incredible friends to help me when I'm in need.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 38th time. The tested sentence is:  So its not as bad as i think.  i go to get weighed in on tues....I really was expecting to weigh at least 4 lbs more. I mean i ate and drank like a champ this weekend. But when i stepped on the scale it said 204.8! so i lost .2 lbs. Thats nothing, but its better than gaining!  ttyl I drank all weekend long...I partied my ass off...got wasted...ate pot brownies..then ate lots of food. God why did i do this to myself?  See when I get wasted I screw up on my diet.  Iam going to LA today...cross your fingers for me. I hope i didnt gain all teh weight back that i lost(the entire 4.5 lbs..) I will let you know.... Went to LA yesterday!! Down to 205!! lost 1.4 lbs.  Its a start! GOOOOO MEEE! So i went back yesterday afternoon.  My weight was 206.4. So i dropped one pound! I guess it wasnt so bad since I drank lots of beer on friday night.  Other than that I think I did pretty well on my diet this past week.  Its been soooo hard making sure I eat all the food I am supposed to in the day.  This weekend is going to suck though. I have people coming in from out of town so all we are going to be doing is drinking and eating...Whats a fat girl to do??? So i spent another $212. dollars on those freakin bars yesterday.  What a ripoff this place is becoming.  So far it i have spent 540 +212 = 752 dollars.  That could of been my freakin Louis Vuitton Bag!! I am so pissed. But I swear if i lose this weight I WILL BUY MYSELF A FAB PRESENT. I WILL BUY MYSELF A VERY EXPENSIVE PURSE!! 160 POUNDS IS ONLY 50 POUNDS AWAY!!  So i have to lose only 57 more pounds...UGH...i cant take it... Til next time.... Ok. so I think this may be easier to see my results by keeping a diary of them. so here goes  So i joined La weight loss on tuesday...Walked in wanted to lose 30 lbs. but in reality really need to lose like 70 to be my "ideal" weight...what a crock. So anyway when i was in there i honestly thoguht the girls we on crack.  So happy to see ms.fatty herself walk in.  So basically they completely bring me down and tell me the only way i will ever be skinney is through them...so what does a fat girl to do? So i decide to join....oh no here goes.... So they do the membership and $600.00 dollars later i walk out with this juice and the idea that in only 15 weeks i will be 30 lbs liter.  Wish me luck... So anyway think two days later...I have eaten all the meats and green leafy veggies that i can. Even when i shitz its plain green...how gross.  And that nasty drink..tastes like crap and smells even worse. But I do it and I go back to LA for my next consultation.  This is where they weigh me and TADA! I have lost 1.7 lbs.  Geez dont know how...but lets see thats a good start. So they sit me down and feed me more crap about their company and continue to put me on this pedastol...(i am trying to figure out what they are on...whatever it is...i want some).  So they put me in this room to watch a video on these lite bars that supposedly without them you wont lose the weight...but i thought in the commercial you could eat your own foods...DUH stupid me. Guess i should of known better. So then after the video they proceed to tell me i can open up this credit card to pay for these bars...what a crock of shit. So I tell them no, and they proceed to tell me they are gonna cost me over $900.00 BUT i am saving $500.00 by doing it this way.   So now i am thinking god. i just spent $540 dollars to join and now they want another $1400 from me...OMG what an idiot i am.  Who told me to sign up for these things?   So I leave in not such a great mood...Kinda rude to the cracked out consultants that work there.  Oh well.  But i did lose 1.7 lbs! So i guess its a start.  So here goes.  My weight(which by the way I would NEVER tell anyone) started at 209.3. Now 207.4lbs.  so i will type more after my next meeting.... bye! Well here goes.  What a bad weekend. I went to get weighed in on sat and i was 197.6.  So i lost only .2 lbs once again.  So of course i was super pissed.  I decided to just eat and eat untill i burst i guess.  I didnt eat what i wasnt supposed too, i just ate everything on my daily diet within 5 hours.  I dont know why.  Then the next day i ate pizza, and bread and all kinds of bad stuff.  Then i came home really late and ate peanut butter and jelly sndwh, a shit load of veggies and cheese and rice cakes. All within 15 minutes.  I completely gorged myself sick.  I then decided to drink this diet tea shitz.  Well, i thought i was going to die with all the stomach pains i was havign this mornign. But i did cleanse my entire system out.  I am sure there is none of that left.  God i sat on the toliet for almost 1 hour with the worst freakin cramps EVER.  I havent figured out why i do this to myself. WENT TO LA TODAY! LOST 2.4 LBS SINCE MONDAY! I am so freakin happy! i now weigh 197.8 lbs!  I am finally weighing as much as Eric does!  This in great! I am sooo happy!  And only 18 more lbs til I hit my goal weight!  Then after that I can continue this diet until I weigh 150 lbs.  OMG if i can actully go to 180, then going to 150 wont be that much harder.  I just have to stick it out until next summer.  Make this a way of life for me.  I know i have to stop drinking that diet tea though. I am sure that dieteritcs arent the best, but it helps cleasne me out!  I will write more after my next visit.  I cant believe i ate that much ice cream and didnt gain. I guess considering it was fat free and then i puked out like 1/2 of it anyway.  I guess no matter what i do, I will always have my eating disorder. I hope that by losing the weight the healthy way I can try to maintain it and not let it get out of control, the way it did  before.  Well its been over 1 month since i joined LA and when i started i was 209.7.   Now i am 197.8.  Thats 11.9 lbs lost so far.  I started June 16.  That is 5 weeks. so that is an average of 2.38 lbs per week. since i have about 4 more weeks til vacation that means i can lose another 9.52 lbs by then. I do want it to speed up though.  I want to be skinny for my fam to see me.  but 190 is nothing. But 185 would be nice...180 would be better.  but i highly doubt i can lose 17.8 lbs in 3 weeks.  thats 6 lbs a week!   But we can try right? Well, Its offical. I finally lost some weight.  I am now 200.2.  So i lost some. Not much at all. So its like 9.5 lbs so far.    Well nothing is new, cept i quit drinking for the time being.  That should make quite a difference. The problem is that what am i supposed to do in my free time now that i am not a lush? I will write more later Ok...if this isnt bad...i dont know what is.  Going on my fourth week of la.  I now weight a TOTAL OF 202.2! I have been back and forth at 202 for the past 2 weeks.  I know i am not at a standstill..i just cant stop eating!! Agh! sooo freakin aggreavating!  I am going to follow the diet to a T. Starting today. No cheating. Nothing out of the diet. No snacking AND no late eating.  Last meal at 7. Only a fruit after that.  God..if I ever asked you for one thing. Let it be this. I know this sounds so stupid. But i would be a happier person if i was thinner. Everything for me would come together. My life...everything. I just want to lose this weight. I just want to be skinnier.   Please give me the strength and the will power not to gourge myself everyday and follow this meal plan exactly! i need to lose this or i will lose everything important to me.  i have a really bad feeling my man will leave me.  What will i do with Jacob?  Ok...this pretty much blows...so i went to la this morning. I was actually(this might sound dumb that a 200 lb person can say this) but i felt skinny todya...honestly thought this stupid cantalope express would work. BUT I WAS WRONG...i GAINED .2 LBS. so now I am up to 202.4.  This sucks.  i did definitely cheat on the diet though. I ate wingys last night...SOOOOO and i ate a peanut butter rice cake. SO i blew it. But i am starting over fresh today. I really, really hope that i can get below 200 by the end of the week.  That was my goal.  But doesnt seem like it is giong to happen. If i could just keep my mouth wired shut then i wouldnt have this problem.  Thats my biggest problem. I eat when i am not even hungry.  I need to figure out why and how to stop it.  CAN ANYONE HELP???? I hate this...i mean...its coming off...but really freakin slow!! I am down to 202.2... I am doing this express take off thing right now...Basically its like starvign yourself..I better lose weight from this! i swear this is hard to do...i willlet you know how the express thing goes.  I will type more on wednesday.! OK. SO I OVERGUESS MYSELF.  I HONESTLY THINK I AM GIVING THIS FIGHT UP.  I WENT TO GET WEIGHED IN TODAY.  I AM DOWN TO 195.8.  SO I HAVE LOST 14 LBS EXACTLY.  TAKES SOOO LONG. I MEAN I AM HAPPY THAT I AM NOT OVER 200 ANYMORE, BUT ITS TAKING SO FREAKING LONG TO GET OFF.  THEY UPED MY FOOD BY 1/2 PROTEIN AND ONE STARCH.  THEY SAID IT WOULD HELP ME LOSE THE WEIGHT FASTER.  THEY SAID I WORK OUT TOO MUCH FOR THE DIET I AM ON. I NEED TO EAT MORE SO MY BODY BURNS THE FAT.  I AM SO IRRATED WITH THIS SLOW WEIGHT LOSS.  LAST TUESDAY I WENT IN AND I ACTUALLY GAINED A POUND. HOW CRAZY IS THAT.  I JUST CANT WAIT UNTIL I AM 180.  THAT WAY I KNOW THAT 160 IS CLOSE BY. NOW THAT IS ONLY 16 LBS AWAY BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT COME OFF FASTER. I AM NOT CHEATING. I AM NOT EATING THE WRONG THINGS. I AM WORKING OUT LIKE A MANIAC AT THE GYM.  DONT KNOW WHY ITS JUST NOT WORKING! ANY SUGGESTIONS????  PS I STILL REMEMBER THINKING I AM SO FAT. I WEIGH 181. I CANT CONTROL MYSELF. NOW LISTEN TO ME I WEIGH 15 LBS MORE THAN THAT AND I WOULD BE HAPPY AT 181. OK. so my trip to la last week. I was pretty bummed out. When i got on the scale i had gone back up to 197.8. So the lady sat me down and told me i have been going to that location for 5 weeks. I had only lost 7 lbs in those 5 weeks. Iwas 3 lbs behind schedule.  I honestly dotn know what i have been doing wrong.  All i do is measure, weigh and work out.  WHat a pain.  But then i went on sat, and i was down to 196.4. So I should be at 194 by now...This really sucks my ass.  I have to lose 17 more lbs by my birthday. Only less than 2 months away.  So far i have lost 13.3 lbs.  I dont know what to do.  I defintiely cant be the fat ass walking into this wedding.  Everyone saw my skinny pictures and knows at one point i only weighed 160 lbs.  I swear thats 37 lbs away.  But if i could lose the next 17 for the wedding. Then it would be fab.  Keep u updated

A box is useful for lots of things like keep old magazines and old stuff we don't use anymore but we don't want 2 throw out...    we can also use a box to make something like a television...yeah, a television, not like real televisions but a cool television that doesn't transmits any program...ok, it's useless...  ***take care*** hi there...!   i want 2 make a website for myself but i don't know how 2 do it...free...!!   my Msn doesn't work...shit...   i don't know what 2 write so i'll pass 2 the...

+++++ THE GENDER: FEMALE equals to: FEMALE
ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 40th time. The tested sentence is:  Ding dong, the kids have gone, and after the drama of our gas leak yesterday, Cat and I are now safely back in our rooms.  And the campus is quiet - Kathryn, Louise and I will just have to work for three or four hours and then our weekend kicks off.  Should be an OK one, but really I am all about getting my room started on being sorted and reading to pack up before heading home.  Yes.  Tonight was pretty nice - Daphne, Cat and I went to see   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  , finally.  It was really good, I thoroughly enjoyed iy  , but I am kind of nervous to estimate what they may do to my favourite of the books,   Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  !!  Then we all went for pizza, and I had nice phone chats with Natalie and Val.  Val is almost recovered from the trauma of last term, and Natalie and I are meeting for dinner and drinks on Saturday.  Am glad I've had a few ops to see her whilst I've been down in Londonshire.  Right, am going to go watch an ep of   Sex and the City   now!  Current music:  the   Sex and the City    theme tune Current mood: fine Last person spoke to: the ever lovely Cat, whilst she waxed her legs (oh, the joys of living together!! :-)) Next:   Sex and the City  , closely followed by no sex in bed.  Seriously, how long has it been?  About two years you say?  Dayum.... Why do I always feel so tired at the moment?  What can I say, motivation is running a little low.  This may or may not be down to my job, which at the moment is taxing  and  boring, always a dangerous combination.  Nevermind, long weekend coming up.  And then it's the final week of working here before heading oop north.  Fab.  Called Storrsie today.  She sounds a little down at the mo, but I can totally empathise.  As fab as it is to go home and all, I hate that feeling on the first night back, after the manic catch up chats, when you are lying there in your jammies, staring at the ceiling, and thinking - what the fuck do I do now?  I mean, it always turns out well, but I hate that first night back feeling.  Still haven't heard from festival. Not for the first time, procrastination may have fudged up things.  Cat had to move out into one of the other boarding houses tonight (I'm already having to), because our gas sprang a leak.  Drama, anyone?  Current Music: RHCP: Higher Ground Current mood: sustained averageness Last person spoke to: MOSOD for Millfield Next:   what do you think?  Table dancing and Cristal? Tobey and Jake?  Or teeth and bed? Can't go to sleep just yet, so I thought I'd fill this in instead (cheers to whoever I nabbed it from).

If I were a musical instrument, I would be: a cello - curvy and resonant!  If I were an animal, I would be: a monkey or a mongoose or a cat  If I were a color, I would be: Blue or purple  If I were an emotion, I would be: Joy, contentment, and hope (at least that's what I aspire to be :-)).  If I were a vegetable, I would be: a tomato  If I were a sound, I would be: laughter  If I were an element, I would be: Oxygen - necessary for life, but deadly if you don't know how to handle it!  If I were a car, I would be: a VW beetle  If I were a song, I would be: undecided!  For today, let's say 'Hallelujah', the Rufus Wainwright version  If I were a movie, I would be directed by: Steven Speilberg or Frank Capra.  And I'd be proud of it!

If I were a cartoon character I would be: Calvin, Hobbes, or Garfield.  If I were a shape I would be a: An oval, or a star.  Et voila, c'est moi!  Ish.  Night.  May all your dreams be peaceful and blissful tonight. It really is extremely cold for July.  I'm originally from deepest darkest Scotland, so you know when I put on a sweater, I ain't playing.  But it feels practically autumnal.  After a beautiful May and an iffy June, July is shaping up to be pretty poor.  So I am sat here, typing, looking out of the window.  It's not even my window - no, tonight (and yesterday and tomorrow) I have to give up my cozy little room and stay in one of the other houses.  Odd, especially as I'd just gotten used to the last room!  It's really dark out there.  Inside the house I can hear the creaks as the house settles, adults brushing their teeth and phoning loved ones to say goodnight, kids sleeping heavily in strange beds.  But outside is noiseless, still, eerie.  From here I can see the music block, it's lone security lamp a bright beacon against the deep dark around the rest of the view.  We are usually spoilt with lighter skies in the summer, but tonight (at just gone 11), the sky is midnight blue, with a deep pink haze in the west as the final few warm bits of sunlight flicker and fade away.  Whenever I look out of a window, I always think of who else might be doing so, and once I've numbered my family and friends, I always wind up pondering the same people - the men in my life, past and present.  Yep, the same people I think of when it's rainy, or last thing at night, or when I've had a little too much wine.  Who else is under that shy?  Is Tim looking up there now?  If he is, I bet he's not thinking of me.  I can't believe I fouled it up so comprehensively with him.  I really liked him and I guess he liked me (well, so much that he came out and said so), but then it all hit the fan.  I just hope he knows I care about him, and I hope we can salvage what was essentially a good friendship, before "relationship" stuff got in the way.  Al's out there somewhere too - ah, the one that never was.  Such a good friend, but I think he's destined to be forever and always, the man that got away.  There were a couple of moments where I thought - maybe - dancing together, walking arm in arm, discussing jokingly our marriage in our thirties.  Foolishness, I know, but sometimes in the wee small hours it's those warm and fuzzies that I depend on to keep me warm.  There are others too - men I've cared about, men I've hurt, men I've used, men who've made me cry, men who've kissed me till my lips tingled, men who have given me a glimpse of who I might really be - and men who have done all of the above.  Who's next on the list?  I am tired of kissing frogs!  The last person I had as a proper boyfriend was back in high school, and I don't even have anyone to crush on (except the aforementioned Tim and Al, bith of whom I would hazard are now firmly part of "the friend zone").  I want someone to call my own, not another to just kiss and dismiss.  I always get rid of them - will I ever learn to trust?  I hope so.  Current music: "Let Your Love Flow" on my 1st mix from JW.  Nice. Current mood: reminiscent, longing, dreamy. Last person spoke to:  Daphne (looking for a mosue), Cat (reclaiming the laptop and saying good night) Kathryn and Louise (signing off). Next:  into PJs, brushing teeth, grabbing teddy bear and sweet, sweet sleep. Can't stand that day.  Quite.  Well I should really be at lunch, but I figured I'd get this post sorted first.  The school is absolutely crawling with posh kids, and of course a committee of vahry posh adults too (who keep on pestering me with requests for extra pillows, sliced rather than diced ham, and a million and one other things that would never occur to a less eccentric soul).  She works hard for the money?  Hell, yes. But hey, I managed to escape at ten thirty for a couple of hours, so it's not all bad.  I am spending so much time online at the moment.  As well as FT, I am also spending a lot of time on YMDB, which is great fun.  I just love talking (or should that be typing) about films.  I really hope I can get back to studying them one day!     Got a letter from Sian-shine this morning, which was cool.  I really do love letters, as old school as that sounds.  Must write more soon.  Speaking of stuff I'd better do soon, studying and packing come to mind.  This room is a tip, and yet I'm off home in two weeks.  Shite, better hit it.  Current music:  Nelly Furtado, Powerless.  I like this song, but it's not as good as Try. Current mood:  coasting along.  You? Last person spoke to:  Cat, who's just gone into London.  Jealous, moi? Next:  finding a courier company, facing the firing squad (my meal numbers were out), and grabbing  sandwhich. Have you ever had one of those days where everything seems to move that bit slower?  Today was one of those.  I lazed around in bed till 11, 11.30, then showered and sat around in my towel (great look, right?), FTing and emailing.    Then at four, back to work.  We've got the prep schools tennis in now, and they are already proving to be hard work!!  But that's cool - in a fortnight I'll be almost done and preparing to go home.  Yes!  No doubt I'll be bored stiff after about 24 hours of the old hometown, but I know I really need to recharge, laze on the beach, drink wine, study up for next terms classes, pack up for the moves....  So I'll close now (my journals    always   end up sounding like letters.  No hangover today (still haven't grown into them, thank heavens!), but am pecked oot.  Current music:  The Keane album, Hopes and Fears.  It's pretty good, but my faves are still the singles (Somewhere Only We Know, and Everybody's Changing), and the single-to-be (Bedshaped). Current mood: Tired, happy, wistful, confused, anticipatory. Last person spoke to:  Kathryn and Louise, to sign off for the night.  Breakfast duty tommorrow - yuck. Next:  A little fametracker, then beddy-byes.  Mmmmmm. Good night out by all accounts. Cat and I went into London tahn to enjoy our last day off together before she heads off on contiki.  We went shopping, then went to wagamama for dinner (chicken ramen, yay!).    After that we went to Hillsong which was amazing - I just love feeling so connected!!  I may actually pluck up the courage to go alone next week.... Then after the service we headed to not one, but two Walkabout bars, and had a good night.  Quite a bit of totty around, including a rather tasty young man named Mike from home I got a kiss.  And then bolted, 'cos after all, when there's only two in a group, pullings a wee bit out of order.  So we got the train home.  And I'm absolutely knackered!  Current music:  Shania Twain - From This Moment On (ah, the joys of web radio during the wee hours of Sunday morning!) Current mood: tired, tipsy and happy Last person spoke to:  Cat and our taxi driver! Next: bathroom and bed.  Zzzzzzzzzz First post today.  Have just eaten chocolate for both breakfast and lunch, so will no doubt have to go forage for food soon.  Cannot believe this weather - hailstones in July?  I have no idea what I'll wind up writing about in this blog, but hopefully it'll get interesting.  Off to London now, so better change out of my towel.  Current music: some rocky pish on radio 1 Current mood: apathetic! Last person I spoke to:  the lovely Kitcat Plans: shopping, Hillsong and the pub.  And more time online naturally.  I'm such a geek!
+++++ THE GENDER: MALE equals to: FEMALE
ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 41th time. The tested sentence is:  Now I don't think I have ever called him Chewy to his face. In fact I am not sure I remember how he got that name....something about back hair?  My friend Brian Jeanseau is the monthly Blog Star. I will be highlighting a new person in my life each month that inspires me, encourages me, or makes me laugh. This month's BS does all three.      Let's start with why Brian inspires me...  Brian is one of the most real people I have ever met. He is honest, forthright, and nice when doing it. Brian cares for his family. I think that is fantastic. He provides for his family, financially and I know he takes his wife on dates. I have observed him being an excellent husband and father.  Brian is encouraging. He recently took over as worship leader for our church and is doing a phenomenal job. I felt SO cared about the first week after worship he sent all of us an email informing us of how proud he was....so neat. He is always pushing me a little further than I want to go, and I truly feel he believes in me...I cannot say that about very many people.  Brian makes me laugh...mallard duck. Enough said.  I think Brian is one of the best people that I know and all of you should be lucky enough to have a friend like Brian.  Kat I have become a member of the "Check Fraudulence Club." No I have not started conterfeiting checks in the McVicker's basement(next to the Meth Lab...AKA "Brew Kitchen"). Yours truly had some checks that got into the hands of the devil's handy men(or women for that matter). Okay so I am kidding about the DH men...just need a little humor. I came home on Wednesday from a relaxing evening in the suburbs to find a letter from Winco Foods notifying me of a dishonored check. I thought that was weird since I have not shopped there in forever and I certainly did not spend $129. I mean come on...I don't think I have EVER spent that much on groceries..I am single...well maybe when I was a youth leader and all of those teenagers eating me out of house and home. Anyways I called the store and found out there was another check for $98...called the bank the next day to find out it is 6 checks thus far. Did I mention that this is on my closed account from WA? Yeah so I had to file a police report, they are sending me some stuff to sign, then as far as I know now I will have to take a police report to each place that this person wrote a check..needless to say I was hacked. I was more stressed than anything.  Tommorow I am teaching on Phil. 4:6-7  Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  Kinda funny the scripture that I have been studying for the last week and a half is perfectly applicable to my present life circumstances.  I have spent the last couple of days realizing how truly blessed I am, which leads me to being thankful. I have had a really shitty last year, but despite the ebb and flow of life I realize I always come out of it fine. I survive.   The God that is my very breathe, my very reason for living, is my strength. Father I thank thee.   I am thankful for relationships, love, truth. Father I thank thee.   Take time this week to be thankful for your existence, purpose, and His divine beauty shining on you.  Kat I watched the movie Grand Canyon last Sunday. I had not seen that movie in several years and was surprise by the poignant theme. I came away from that movie thinking/rethinking a lot of stuff in my own life as to how I am living and how that may/may not affect my world, my community.   Fast forward to Friday I am driving to work and I take a different route one that included me stopping by the yuppie Safeway(have you seen the ones with track lighting in the cheese/wine section?) for an energy bar before work. I decided to go up Cornell to 158th and drove by the large building I drive by on the 26 occasionally. I always looked closely at this building wondering what it was. They were obviously doing some sort of additions and thought it was perhaps a new college building or perhaps a high school, or a home for corporate offices of some sort. To my amazement it was a church. I saw the sign for a presbyterian church and was speechless. Now what I am about to write may seem judgemental...but I need to pose the question...why? I don't get it. I don't. Multi-million dollar(guessing...not really sure of the exact numbers) building projects when there are people with no food or clothes for people in the community. I just don't get the world today. I don't understand how we have a society in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. I was angry when I saw that it was a church. I am not trying to be a bleeding heart liberal but I feel something is severely wrong with this picture.   I was reading Blue like Jazz by Donald Miller again this week and he writes about problems. He states that the problem does not lie in the politics of the world, the church, but essentially the problem lies within us. He states that the only true change, true life-giving, God-honoring change would have to start with the individual. I whole-heartedly agree. It does begin with me.  When I have these moments of enlightenment I am jacked up and ready to make a change. I harbor these utopian ideas of evolving into a better person. I need to give more, consume less, live a life of simplicity. Give to the poor, I don't really need to buy make-up or shoes, I can give it away. I don't need to drive or buy products that are not good for the environment. I make list after list of all of the things I want to change about myself, my habits, only to be disappointed at my lack of discipline and follow-through. So I ask myself, how do I make changes in my life? Miller says that the path to joy winds through a dark valley of our own depravity.   I know that are times in my life when I have looked at my own crap and been so completely discouraged at my progress. I see who I am and all that I aspire to be and it makes me sad that I fall SO short of my expectations. The only thing redeemable thing about my life is the fact that as I may be overly critical of myself,God is not that way. In fact he is just proud of me that I get up and make the effort to live my life and want him to be apart of that. I think that things will really start to change not only in my own heart, but in the hearts of men and women in this world is when we see that we are a really screwed up people in need of someone to save us. Yes the problem is in me, but there is someone who wants to hold me, love me, and show me who I was intended to be without all of my self-absorption. In the light of that knowledge we CAN as Eugene Peterson says be made into our true selves, our child-of-God selves.  Peace   Kat Each year as my birthday comes and goes, I take a significant amount of time reflecting on the past, present, and what is to come. Periodically a sense of nostalgia comes over me as I smell a familiar scent or hear a song that takes me to another place. These moments lead me to recall old memories, some joyous, others despairing. Recently I has one of these occasions as I began to read past journal entries.   Journaling for me has become one of my most treasured activities. It is a place that I bear my soul, process through emotions, and pray. Most of it is prayer. I write these letters to God of my pain, fraility, and my lack of understanding the mystery. I pour out my love, gratitude, and desire...passionate letter after passionate letter.  In these letters I record not only my own voice but the voice of the One who weeps with me, laughs with me, and renews hope within my feeble heart.   When I was in middle school I had a diary. I was good about writing in it. It always felt funny to write my thoughts, activities, and emotions to "Diary". It was pointless to me. I remember at slumber parties we used to read each others diaries if we were "best friends"....only your BF could know the intimate details about you. I remember some of the things I used to read, " We went to the mall today," or "I really want a new phone,"...mine were always something about a boy. "I really wish Josh McDonald would be my boyfriend." Josh McDonald was my sixth grade crush who did not have a clue as to who I was until 7th grade when I became popular. Look back at those times, now at 26, I wish I would have kept those old pages. To be able to see the reality of middle school dating rearing it's ugly head again almost 15 years later would be humbling. Girls, I don't think we ever grow out of our girly middle school phase. We still ask each other info about what the boy said, we still get all stupid and googly, and we still think that the world would be complete if we just had "the boy." I'll try not to continue with this tangent and save it for the book. There is still something very sacred about the contents of a diary/journal that even only your closest friends are able to know your thoughts. Even with that said I only read exerpts from my journals to my most intimate friends...which consists of 2-3 people. And with that there is only one person who I would let hold the treasured contents and read it for themselves(you know who you are). It is a very very intimate thing.  Over almost 9 years I have written in everything from notebooks, cutesy journals from Old Navy, to napkins from coffee shops. I am somewhat of a minimalist so everything that is not being used is in the trash or on the way to the Goodwill...but never my old papers. There are moments, emotions, and journeys recorded in these books that would make an excellent made for T.V. movie. I read my earliest prayers and note that everything is flowery and pretty using big words like majesty, king of kings, and holy of holies. Over the years this was toned down as I grew in my relationship with God to words like my friend, my father, with the occasional king thrown in. Then there were the crying out for God years...that is where my pain began to seep into my view of God. My self-inflicted wounds causing me to to question whether or not he was there. My faith diminishing under the weight of disbelief, so I yelled, screamed, and cursed at God. He became at that point a comforter, lover, and a savior in a way I had not understood and still am trying to comprehend today.  Now I look back at my life over the last 10 years and I see that it is good. I struggle with my desire to be all that I aspire to be , yet all that He has created me to be...eventually I will grasp that these coincide. I see the person that I am becoming and it excites me. Not because of anything that I have achieved, but because I can see the miracle within me. I see the person I was, I am, and who I am becoming and I am awed by the work of his hand. Who ever thought he would take a snobby materialistic girl and change me into who I am being molded into?  I look over my relationships and am awed. I think back to years past and all of my friendships were somewhat superficial. This year brought some relationships to a close, but by the closing it brought a depth of love and understanding to some that lacked. It also brought the emotional availability to invest in new friendships. My friend Matt, who I would say is my best friend, has taught me new things that I never thought I could learn. We have fought over everything there is to fight over, disagreed on everything, and for a period of time could not stand each other. I have a greater understanding of fighting for people in relationships because he fought for me. He did not give up and now he is reaping the fruit of his hard labor...I am no longer a bitch(most of the time). I guess that is a miracle...he would say so. My friends Trissa, Julie, and Curtis have all had a hand in shaping me into the person that I am becoming. Entry after entry usually includes something that one of them has said to encourage, stimulate, or piss me off. It is so good.         These are pictures that were taken from my 26th birthday party. The picture with Trissa, Alicia, Matt and I, is my favorite. Allisha and Matt both helped out tons to get the party ready. They both know how stressed out I get at events that I am planning and so they were right there keeping me together. About an hour before the party Matt took over and finished getting things ready while I got dressed. Trissa and Jon arrived about a 1/2 hour later and Jon(who is not familiar with my pre-party stress) said, "Someone get this girl a drink." Trissa replied, "This is just how she is before the party. As soon as people begin to arrive she will be a completely different person...laughing, enjoying herself." She was right. It is so nice to have people in your life that know you so well. These relationships continue to go through trials and tribulations and each time we all learn a new meaning for words like love, forgiveness, understanding, and compassion. I am the person I am because of the people that play the part they are supposed to play in the symphony of life. Each instrument, each note being played, sometimes not harmonically, but after much practice and devotion...the music is played and flows into the beautiful melodies that are intimate relationships.

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 42th time. The tested sentence is:  I love to eat, as obviously seen in my body.  I also love trying out new restaurants.  One of my goals is to try out all the restaurants in Greenbelt 2 and 3 before, if ever, theyâ€™ll close down.  Another dream is to be a food/ restaurant critic in magazines or newspapers.  But I doubt that it can happen since I am not a professional writer and writing is one of my waterloos.  Thatâ€™s why I had been thankful with blog somehow, at least I can express my thoughts and practice being a critic.  Hehe.  Anyway, last Saturday was the graduation of my brother, Eric, from Grade7.  And just as any family after graduation, we dined out.  My dad suggested that we should eat in Greenbelt since Iâ€™ll be coming from Makati, and maybe heâ€™s thinking that in this way heâ€™ll not spend much.  But me and my siblings goal is to squeeze to the last centavo all the money of my dad.  So, my sister suggested Nuvo, a fine dining restaurant in Greenbelt2.  The place is known for itâ€™s being a fine dining restaurant.  Of course, we tried what could be the most expensive meal.  Some food fancy me, however, it seems like the resto is fond of goose liver so much, that almost every meal has goose liver for its sidings.  I am not fond of goose liver.  So, I settled with blue marlin with prawns.  As for other fine dining restos, this is not a place for heavy eaters.  This is an ideal place for those who are on diet or who are in a date and doesnâ€™t want to eat a lot.  Food arrive in less time.  I liked the prawns, however, the blue marlin is a little salty.  The rice had been good for me its serving was half-cup, since this is my ideal serving of rice.  My brother ordered tenderloin steak, which is tasty (Iâ€™ve tried it) and the sidings of baked potatoes are cooked in a healthy way.  But I should have ordered the same as the one beside our table since they have to call the chef and commend him.  Maybe, it would be more satisfying for me if I have tasted the food same as hers.  One of my fetish are the washrooms.  I want to know if theyâ€™re clean and homey.  Scary person as I am, there are many washrooms that were really scary to use.  Scary could mean from dirty to really scary as in I am scared that I could find a ghost.  In Nuvo, the washroom was of a size that can accommodate two to three people.  But the unique thing about their washroom and that most will remember is their sink.  The sink was of flat design.  It is like a make-up room, where you can place down your things while you fix yourself, since it is of a flat design.  You would not think of it as a sink except that it has a faucet above it, attached to the window.  There is no drainage even, and no sign of where the water will go.  Honestly, I was thinking twice if it was a sink.  Then I tried it and yes it is a sink.  Where does the water go?  It goes down to the side of the mirror.  How it goes there and not the other side?  Well, I think you better ask an architect.    If asked if I will try Nuvo again, I definitely will, and I wish by that time I will ask for the chef and commend him for a job well done. Previously on my life: Papaâ€™s girl/ to be seen everywhere except at home/ can lend money to anyone/ have an active social life/ knows whatâ€™s happening with everybody  Today on my life: doesnâ€™t talk to my dad/ just to be seen at home/ doesnâ€™t have money even to lend for myself/ donâ€™t talk much to anyone/ is not familiar anymore with whatâ€™s the latest  Whatâ€™s happening to me? It seems like everything is happening the other way around.  Yes, I am a homebody now.  I know all the telenovelas on TV.  Honestly, the present life bores me.  I miss having excitement in my life.  I just hope that the near future will bring the previous feelings I had that made me love life. â€œWhen a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream.â€? This is a famous line from the book, The Alchemist.  But honestly, I feel otherwise nowadays.  I feel that the universe is conspiring against me.   I resigned from my work last December to pursue my dream even if God is telling me not to (another story).  And that dream is to teach or become a teacher in the pre-school level.  But as the events would have it, it seems like teaching doesnâ€™t like me; just as music is to me.  Of course, I have a back-upâ€¦business.  People would tell me that they really see me having a business of my own, or into sales.  So, I tried to follow their advice.  I used the last salary I received from my previous job in buying ingredients for making cookies.  Because I am a beginner with no real experience in baking, I first tried the Milo cookies.  I got the recipe from the Milo free taste at my brotherâ€™s family day.  But it was failure.  It burned, and every other possible defect that can happen, happened.  I know I made a mistake somewhere, like sifting the flour and chilling the ingredients.  So, for the next batch of cookies, this time Peanut butter Raisin Cookies, I sifted the flour, chilled the ingredients and followed religiously the instruction.  Bam! This time it was worse.  My family didnâ€™t even let me baked the other mixed ingredients left.  And for those that were baked?  It was thrown out after two days, without touching it.  Yes, my family and I did not force ourselves to eat it.    Now, Iâ€™m into a new venture.  The chocolate business.  I am proud to say that can do this and excel in making chocolates.  But does my entire future depend with the chocolates?  I do not know.  I had been a member of the unemployed since January.  Before I resigned, two of my friends told me that I easily find jobs coz God truly loves me, unlike them.  Honestly, I do not think so.  I believe that God loves us equally, itâ€™s just that I really have faith in Him.  And I really do believe in my life verse, Mk 11:24, â€œTherefore, I tell you, whatever you for in prayer, believe you have received it, and it shall be given to you.â€?  One reason I could just resign before even if I still do not have any job waiting because I believed that God will take care of me.  Honestly, now I am kinda losing hope.  I donâ€™t know till when will I be part of the unemployed.  And I donâ€™t know what career to pursue.  I really donâ€™t know.  But one thing I do know, I will not contradict God again in what He tells me even if I want to give up already. I was watching a Filipino telenovela the other night.  And a line really struck me. â€œThe opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference.â€?  Well, I guess it is really true for me.  Coz even if you say that you totally hate this person, but always pays attention to him and thinks often about him, then you still love the person.  But if you say you love a person but youâ€™re indifferent to him and becoming insensitive to his feelings, then think again if you still really love that person.  And donâ€™t people get more hurt if the one they care about is indifferent to them? Am I that bad already? I had been to two retreats already, and itâ€™s not yet the middle of the year.  I hope not.  My guess is maybe God is answering my prayers through these retreats.  And it is true.  My prayers were answered except for one.  Does that mean Iâ€™ll be attending another retreat again before the end of the year?!?!  This leads me to another topic.  Why do I hurt someone I love so much and someone who loves me?  With regards to my family, I have answered that question already.  But with regards to a special friendâ€¦ a special relationship, I am still reflecting on it.  Maybe I am bad after all.  I had been selfish.  I still canâ€™t understand how can I hurt someone who have only shown me love.  Can someone help me understand?? I just came back from visiting provinces in Visayas and Mindanao.  Don't ask me about the tourist spots there for I did not have any opportunity to visit those places.  But I enjoyed my stay in the provinces I have visited.  Also, at last I have reached Mindanao. And been to Camiguin. But just left me bad memories.  The people there are really warm and hospitable except for some.  But never got to enjoy the sites I dreamed of visiting coz I had an accident just before I get to go.  Sad.. Well, all I got in Camiguin are accidents and scars.  I hope next time I visited that place, I'll fully enjoy it.  Next stop.. Batanes (i hope soon..) :) I have realized that looking for a job can be compared to looking for a partner in life.. remember when they compare love to waiting for the rught bus? Well, i believe that finding the right job for you is like that also. Before, if a job would come my way, the first job that would arrive, I would grab. But now, a lot of job offers I forego. Why am I very choosy now? Well, it's because if I'll work now, I want to stay there for a long time already. I would want to grow old there and hopefully to be fulfilled and happy with what am doing. Why? What do I like? I do not know. That's what I want to find out also. God, please help and guide me... it's been over a month already since i last posted here. well, what's new with me? nothing really. still a bum.. realizing my dreams with chocolates.. and trying to get to as much places as possible why i still have no work. Was watching The Practice kanina. And there had been a case where a guy was molested by a priest when he was 18. Well, yung two leads, Bobby and Eugene, nagkaasaran. Coz Bobby is somewhat against the case, and si Eugene he really wanted it. Until Eugene told Bobby what his problem is, itâ€™s because heâ€™s too Catholic. He canâ€™t accept the fact that there are priests out there who do molest innocent youth. And he wants Bobby to get mad as he is to the priests, and stop giving contributions to the church and just leave. Bobby, then talked to one of the other lawyers also who is too catholic. He asked if di ba sya naiilang sa mga accusations sa priests and stuff. Sbe nung other lawyer, sometimes he canâ€™t sleep nga and he pictures God with a human image, he sometimes pictures God as a priest.  Syempre naman, coz parang the priest is the closest to God. But I canâ€™t agree more with what he said when asked if he considered leaving the church. He said, the Church is the faith that you and me have. Mejo can relate kse ako. I have considered once also of changing religions coz of priests. Well, hindi naman ako na-molest, pero nainis ako sa priest. Na parang they are Godâ€™s instrument, God is using them to show His love for us. Pero why are they so mean, why are they so judgmental, tapos yung mga nane-news pa, and etc. etc. Basta nainis lang ako sa isang homily ng priest. So, the next day I texted some BLD Youth for lunch para madiscuss toh. Sobrang confused tlga ako that moment, and mejo decided, but I want to have an opinion of others pa rin before I really do decide. Kaya khet nagyaya yung bago kong boss non na maglunch, I declined and meet with the Youth. Lakas din ng loob ko mag-hindi sa boss noh? Hehe. Anyway, buti na lang I talked to Ate Jopay and Ate Jopay told me that if ever ba Iâ€™ll leave and find another religion..do I think the leaders there would be perfect. As always been said thereâ€™s no perfect community. I know there would be no perfect leaders, pero I was still contemplating about it pa din. I still heard Mass later that afternoon, and asked God kung ano ba tlga. I mean I believe that the Catholics and other religions believe in the same God. So, sbe ko sa Kanya, ano ba mawawala saken? So what happened? Why am I still Roman Catholic? Because God told me to just have faith in him. That the Church still commits mistake coz itâ€™s still composed of humans. And diba nga sbe sa LSS, we are weak and bound to sin? Pero how do we sin ba? Itâ€™s because of freewill. Priests also have freewill, and other religious people. They are human and still make mistakes. Kaya nga we are made e. Coz if there are others who make mistakes, we are there to correct it or show others that not all are like them and there are still others who are good. And we should just have faith.  After watching the show, Iâ€™ve realized that my faith is stronger than before. Coz I think that if I have watched it before, Iâ€™ll again think twice of my religion. Baka magpachange na din ako. Pero kanina, khet na siguro mejo Catholicism didnâ€™t win over, I still believe in the Church that I belong to. Maybe thatâ€™s what over ten years of studying in a Catholic school can do to you. :)

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 43th time. The tested sentence is:  Tomorrow is Lughnassadh, or Lammas, a pagan holiday that celebrates the harvest and the Sun God.  Not sure yet how I'll celebrate.  Make a feast for myself and my boyfriend, and then perhaps a small ritual for myself.  I need to go grocery shopping for this and clean up around the apartment.  -Marquette I'm so glad my summer job of teaching a health and wellness class for high school summer school is almost over.  Let me explain the program a little bit first before getting into my rant....  The Upward Bound program is actually a really cool program.  They have about 30 high school students who are college bound live in the dorms on campus and have their summer school classes on campus for five weeks.  They take science classes, math classes, Spanish, and English during the morning and early afternoon, have recreational activities during the evenings, and the wellness class that I teach three days a week during the evening as well.  Since my class is during the evening, the kids don't really consider it a "real" class, even though the director keeps reminding them they have to pass it in order to go on the trip to Minneapolis at the end of the program.   Alright, so there's a little background.  The director keeps saying how the wellness class is a "real" class, but ya know the ole' saying that actions speak louder than words?  It applies here as well.  Because for everything he says about the wellness class being a real class, he doesn't act like it.  For the awards banquet, all the teachers give academic awards, but traditionally the wellness teacher has never given an academic award.  A new member to the administration questioned that and so I got to give an academic award - but there was a lunch meeting where all the teachers got together and decided the awards together and I wasn't invited.  So come the night of the awards banquet, they all had these plans and spiels they worked on together and I knew nothing about it and kind of ended up winging the whole thing and looking stupid.  A member of the administration also made a memory book and a video - and guess who was the only person in the entire program not shown or mentioned in either one of them?  Yep, you guessed it - me!  And it bothers me as well that people always say "the academic classes and the wellness class."  Excuse me?!  I have a bachelor of science in health - as far as I'm concerned, it is an academic area as well.  Whatever.  I'm working for the program next summer anyway.  Alright, done with my rant.  -Marquette I got my first paycheck from Planned Parenthood today.  Only $150, but hey, that's cool.  First paychecks are always fun too.  So, yesterday I'm visiting one of my co-workers in her office and she handed me three pamphlets.  They're titled "What's Wrong with Contraception?," "The Pill - How does it work?  Is it safe?," and "A Chastity Manifesto."  Let me just quote some of the things that were printed in them...  From "What's Wrong with Contraception?"...  "In the man, vasectomy may cause health problems because of the necessity of the body to reabsorb sperm unable to leave it.  In the long term there is an increased risk of prostate cancer.  The sterilized woman is likely to suffer further gynecological consequences."  What a load of crap.  "The IUD, as a foreign body introduced into the normally sterile environment of the womb, can cause a chronic inflammation and reduced resistance to infections, which, if they get out of hand, can cause further illness including permanent sterility.  It is hardly used in the USA now because the manufacturers have been forced to pay large sums of compensation to users."  First of all, I wouldn't say IUDs are hardly used in the USA anymore.  There are two that I know of that are on the market, and I know we offer one of them at Planned Parenthood.  They are safe to use.  A few decades ago there was a brand of IUD that was taken off the market, but again, that was a long time ago and they're not used anymore.  "There are many harmful side-effects (of the pill) - mild, serious, and even fatal."  Well, all drugs have side effects.  When someone is put on a prescription drug, they should be told what those possible side effects are.  But the worse side effects of the pill are usually for women over 35 who smoke and have a history of things like blood clots - in which case most clinicians wouldn't put that woman on the pill anyway.  Besides, more people have probably died from the side effects of Tylenol than the pill.  But I don't see anyone trying to ban Tylenol.  "When a spermicide is used, there is an increased chance of a miscarriage or of the child being handicapped in the event of conception."  What the bull shit is this?  "The whole point of contraception is to enjoy sexual pleasure while eliminating the possibility of conceiving children."  Well, they finally got something right!  From "The Pill - How does it work?  Is it safe?"  "Is the pill safer than pregnancy?  No.  The health risks of the Pill outweigh by far the risks of pregnancy and childbirth to a woman's health, and any claim to the contrary is based on erroneous comparisons between healthy women on the Pill and women who do not receive normal care during pregnancy."  I think they are just blatantly lying at this point.  There are SO MANY risks to a woman's health during pregnancy and childbirth and to even try and compare using the pill to that and say the pill is more harmful is just ridiculous.   From "A Chastity Manifesto."  "There will be no wide-spread return to non-marital chastity without a rebirth of marital chastity.  It is easier to be chaste when married; married couples need to lead the way."  WHAT?!  Married couples shouldn't have sex?  What's the point of that?  And aside from that, I don't think there's anything inherintly wrong with non-married couples having sex.  I live with my boyfriend, thank you very much, and I don't feel I'm doing anything wrong at all.  Anyways, I could have put a ton more quotes on here, but this entry would end up being llloooonnnnggggg.  Plus, I'm really hungry and some Thai food is sounding good.  -Marquette All I watch, day in and day out, is CNN Headline News.  It's the same shit over and over again.  They don't cover the news I'm even interested in.  But I can't stand FOX news, or all the news talk shows on other networks, so I guess I'm stuck with the headline news.  At least there's the news ticker at the bottom with the sometimes funny and/or interesting little tidbits.    Currently, I'm working as an instructor for a high school health class - it's for a program called Upward Bound.  It's basically summer school for high school kids who are college bound.  They live in the dorms and have their classes on campus.  This is my last week, and I'm excited it's almost over.  When the program started, I was excited about the job, but quickly learned that being a teacher, at least a high school teacher, is not for me.  It has been one of the most frustrating jobs I've ever had.  I will be a teaching assistant for a university class this fall though.  So far I'm pretty optimistic about it.  I'll have a prof with me after all, so it should go smoothly.    Anyway, I've got things to do...  -Marquette Spent the weekend at my parent's house.  My boyfriend came with me and we pitched our tent in the yard.  It was okay.  Some of it was fun, some of it was frustrating.  Saw my sister and her new baby.  A baby's a baby - you've seen one, you've seen them all.  Today was my first full day at Planned Parenthood doing clinic by myself.  Everything went smoothly.  Everyone puts in long days though.  I was there for nine hours, which I guess isn't so bad, but there some days when people put in 11 hour days.  I can't imagine that.   -Marquette My boyfriend and I are going to my parent's house tonight to stay for the weekend.  My sister had a baby about two weeks ago, and she'll be there too.  My boyfriend and I are pitching a tent in the yard though - I won't stay in the house.  My parents don't let us sleep together when we stay there, but at least in the tent we could.  My parents are so funny - I live with my boyfriend, and I sleep with him every night here - why not at their house?  I'm hungry.  There's nothing to eat here.  I kind of want potatoes.  With cheese.  Mmmm.  That sounds really good right now.   I put up a sign on my deck yesterday that says "Pro-Kerry, Pro-Edwards, Pro-Choice."  I don't have a yard to put signs up in, so I put them on my deck facing the road instead.  -Marquette Well, I feel like I have a lot to say right now, so I guess I'll start with my trip from this Monday through Wednesday...  I went on a trip to Minneapolis (did I even spell that right?) with the Upward Bound program I worked for this summer.  30 high school kids and 10 adults on a bus for something like 10 hours...  not the funnest experience in the world.  We get to the city, check into our hotel, and go out for dinner.  I had some serious sinus pressure in my face and thought it was just allergies.  Oh no!  I'm really sick by that night, and spent all of Tuesday in bed in the hotel while the group went to the Science Museum, the zoo, and dinner theatre.  Wednesday I'm still sick, but we checked out of the hotel at 8am and went to Mall of America.  Oh god!  I feel sick, have no money, and am stuck in Mall of America for 5 hours!  Then the bus ride back home.  I'm glad my job with that program is now over and I won't be working for them next summer.  My next rant may be best understood by reading the article at this link first:  urlLink http://www.lufkindailynews.com/news/newsfd/auto/feed/news/2004/08/01/1091333650.18121.3890.4836.html?urac=n&amp;urvf=10917320947500.020138782400256017   I'm all about people expressing their mopinions - it's their right in this country and I would be the last person to take their right away, even if I don't agree with them.  But the guy in this article was crossing the line and harrassing this  woman who works at an abortion clinic.  I would have tried to get a restraining order.  He followed her around town, for christ's sake!  I call that stalking!   Anyway, I guess that's about it.  I'm glad I don't have to work until Monday again.  It'll be nice to relax for awhile.  -Marquette Had a HUGE dinner tonight.  Unfortunately, because I was cooking and baking all day, the apartment became sweltering hot.  Went swimming - Lake Superior wasn't cold for the first time that I've been in it this summer.  Was in the water for over an hour, swam out to some rocks and hung out for awhile.  Watched a movie, and am putting off packing my shit for the trip to Minnesota tomorrow.  I'm not looking forward to going.  I'll be on a bus for hours with 30 high school kids and a handful of adults that I don't really know that well.  I'll be bringing a disc man and a shit load of CDs and some books.  I'd prefer to keep to myself for as long as possible.   -Marquette

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 45th time. The tested sentence is:  They say that lack of sleep contributes to an unstable metabolism, therefore causing it to slow down...I don't know how true that is - all I know is that I find it increasingly harder to function on lack of sleep.  Sign of old age, maybe?  I don't know - in college I could stay up all night and just be a bit batty the next day - now I'm practically incapacitated.  *shrug*      Anyway, the past few days have been miserable - I wanted to lob off everyone's heads.  But after an awesome prayer service at church on Sunday night, I finally feel like I'm going to be okay.  I was able to get up this morning and spend time with God, but because I didn't walk, I was REALLY groggy.  That could have something to do with going to bed at 1:00 am, though.      I'm heading to Hampton University tomorrow and Wednesday for a grant workshop.  I'll be staying iwth my friends Costa and Victoira Gerousis in their new house in Williamsburg.  I'm excited to see it because their family told me the house is gorgeous.  I'm excited :).      Okay...have to do some more work...just a short update :D Hey guys - just a short update to let you know that I'm going to be bumbling my way through the news today and tonight, probably.  So tune in to WHSV TV 3 and watch me explain what we've been doing WHILE I'm exhausted, tired and grumpy :).      Isn't there anything good to eat anywhere...I'm getting hungry... Okay, it's 10:45 pm and it's quitting time.  I have everything set up for tomorrow and I'm heading home, only to come back at about 8:00 am.  So, hope you're enjoying this!  I'm going to keep it up so everyone can see what's going on in my life...have a great evening and as one of my students used to tell me, "Peace Out..." For those of you familiar with Reddish Knob, here's pictures of the beautiful town of Bridgewater and Harrisonburg from atop Reddish Knob, the tallest peak in the area at about 4500 feet.  There's not much up there, but it's beautiful on a clear day or night - we used to go up and watch meteor showers, sunrises, sunsets...and sing...that was fun.  I went up there this past Sunday because it was so beautiful - I'm a nature chick and love to be outside as much as possible!!  Anyway, hope you enjoy...  urlLink     urlLink I think this is also West Virginia...  urlLink     urlLink And here's teh West Virginia side...  urlLink     urlLink And here's another one...  urlLink     urlLink And yet another room full of supplies going out...  urlLink     urlLink And here's the mountain of notebooks and paper that are taller than ME :D  urlLink     urlLink This is just an example of some of the stuff we've been collecting...as you can see, my assistant Sarah can't exactly get to her desk...  urlLink     urlLink Okay!  It's been a bit since I've gotten the chance to post, but finally I'm sitting down long enough to do it.  Today has been extremely hectic - I had to travel to Roanoke for a meeting and was planning on visiting and eating with a few friends/family, etc.  But that was dashed when I had to rush back to Harrisonburg and take care of some things for this big event we're having Saturday adn the book bag stuffing we're having at work tomorrow.  Yeehaw - TV station will be there and everything.      You should currently see my office...as a matter of fact, I'm going to post a picture of it later.  It's covered in school supplies...as most who know me can figure, my office is a comlete wreck in the first place - adding about $8400 worth of school supplies in here does NOT help the decor.      Anyway, got back and ran around picking up the donated supplies and have spent the last 3 to 4 hours inventorying (is that a word??) everything to know what we've received.  I will then have to set up all the supplies for tomorrow's packing day. But I can't until everyone from the other side of this job leaves or THEY'LL try to take the supplies. (There's a church and then there's a social services side to this place...I work for the social services side).      And as I type a mountain of book bags just slid to the floor.  I hope those notebooks don't fall or I may not live to tell about it...it's currently taller than me :).      Next I'm going to talk about the struggle I went through today and learned from.  This will be interesting.  While I was in Roanoke, I had a slight emergency that needed to take care of.  No one here where I work knows how to use a computer except for the limited knowledge that my assistant has.  She was not in, she had a baby appointment.  So, I didn't want to try and walk someone through it over the phone because I knew it would take forever.  I asked a friend if they could do the task for me - no, they didn't have time but if I couldn't find anyone else, then they would do it.      I don't like to inconvenience anyone, so I said no, I'll find someone else.  But inside I was frustrated, because I know my tendancy to drop everythign I'm doing to try and help this person.  My pride started bullying up and I was getting upset because I would have done it for them.      But I  KNEW  this was wrong - this person usually tries to help me whenever they can and I was just looking for a reason to get upset - I have NO CLUE why.  I prayed and cried out to God to help me with the emotions I was dealing with, because they were irrational.  I told Satan to leave me alone and Voila! - I was later able to call this person back when they had called and asked if I had gotten the job done, and tell them YES, I got it done.      But here's the coolest thing.  God knew this person would not be able to do what I had asked because it ended up taken a person who worked here with me to straighten out a problem that came up.  Yes, it took me a whole hour to explain to someone how to get the document onto a disk and take it where it needed to be, BUT the problems that arose were easily solved WHILE I was still in Roanoke because my assistant came in and took care of the rest.      God is awesome in His workings, and my brain knows that, but my heart never wants to trust it.  You see, immediately after I praised God for helping me with that situation, knowing that he wants me to rely on HIM and not on the people I ask for help, I began to think, " Well, God only cared about this person's time and that's the reason He worked it out the way He did. He knew it would take up all of this person's time with the problem and so He didn't let Him say yes.  "  Isn't that awful?  Satan is TRYING to keep me convinced that God doesn't love me and He won't take care of me.  So I just have to keep fighting these thoughts and Satan.  But it's NOT easy.       I am REEEAAALLLYYYY tired - so I'm going to go out and get some fresh air and then come back here and get everything ready for tomorrow.  Please feel free to comment with your own experiences, because I'd LOVE to know I'm not the only one that struggles with being petty and imature at times :).  If I  AM  the only one, then oh well... Another picture of Santa Ward - Had to share this one with you all! He's on a bike in an old empty Wal-Mart Building. I work for a local private social service organization and we hand out toys at Christmas time and this is the toy shop we set up...Ward is delivering one of the gifts *grin*...     urlLink     urlLink Yeehaw...today has been an interesting day so far. I woke up and went walking, and SO enjoyed the weather. We have a cold front moving through thanks to hurricane Alex, and it was in the 50's or 60's this morning. I love this weather - it makes me want to skip directly to fall, which is my FAVORITE time of year.      We're out putting "Tools For School - School Supply Distribution" Posters up all over the city of Harrisonburg. My co-worker can't find a babysitter and to help him out, we've been taking his 4 year old daughter with us (in a car seat of course). She keeps getting confused because Sarah Deavers is the Volutneer Coordinator/my assistant and is driving me to put up the posters...so it's Sarah and Sarah. It confuses everyone, really, because we're in the same office. But she's married and pregnant. BIG DIFFERENCE.      Anyway, her name is Arianna and she is ADORABLE. I can't wait until I have children :)...      okay, time for lunch... JUST IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING - I HATE ASTROLOGY AND PROTEST LOUDLY THAT MY SIGN IS SHOWN - I think it's ridiculous to try to set your future on the creation instead of the one who CREATED it...had to get that out there - I feel much better now.      Oh, and did you check out that cool picture of me on the side - the smaller one? I look like I'm foaming at the mouth *laugh*. For some reason the small picture wants to make my teeth look funny...if you look further down, my teeth actually look pretty normal...ALTHOUGH...      I'll let you in on a secret...I whitened my teeth in photoshop essentials - I drink a lot of moutain dew (I'm trying to quit as always) and my teeth bothered me in the picture...so I photo whitened them ;). He he he...aren't computers handy?? >:D Okay, so it's time to give a bit more of an explanation.  You see, I'm one of those unfortunate people who can't leave things alone and simply analyzes things TO DEATH.  I think through situations and come at them at all possible angles to figure out what could possibly happen so I'll know exactly how to react.  Rantings of a control freak, right?      Well, I'm finding that in the things I participate in my life, they either lead to life or death.  Physically, I can go out and drive my car at insane speeds and ram it into a tree (don't you ever feel like doing that some days?).  That leads to death.      Other days, I go outside and take a walk to excercise, or I decide to eat vegetables from my garden or something silly like that.  That ultimately leads to life.  Healthy life.      Well, I'm finding that it's the same thing in my spiritual life.  I can do things that bring me spiritual life or spiritual death.  And sadly enough, I find myself choosing the spiritual death more often.  Like the Apostle Paul of the Bible mentioned, I do the things I don't want to do and I don't do the things I want to.      Take tonight for instance - I don't want to talk about any of my friends business because I don't want them talking about my failures and pains - a common courtesy thing, you konw?  Don't kick a dog while it's done kind of thing.  And yet I saw someone and started talking about the latest failed marriage.  I don't want to spread those people's misfortune around to others - they have enough to deal with right now without me going on about it.  But I did it anyway.  I still can't quite figure out my motivation other than it was my evil twin.  *sigh*      So what remedies that?  That's what I've been trying to figure out.  I know spending time in God's presence will change that - I can't change anything on my own - only He can.  But that still doesn't make it any easier,  you know?      That's where the title comes from.  I'm spotting life, so to speak, and sharing it with everyone else.  If you see life in what I'm saying, tell me.  If you see death, tell me.  I need all the help I can get! :) Hello! This spot is under construction. It was created in a mindless effort while at work. Yes, I should have been doing the growing list of things to do, but something about the rain and the chocoloate/peanut butter brownies I brought in today caused me to stray from the ultimate task...that and the attraction of a DSL line compared to my Dial-Up at home :). So sit back and join me - I'll have things in order soon enough! Now, this of course, is a test, also - it will be easier to email from home because I don't have a DSL connection there, which I already posted before.  So bare with me until I get myself up and running.    THANKS! urlLink    This is for Beth - Our Hero - Santa Ward!  urlLink urlLink    Cheesin' hard for the TSA Badge...  urlLink

BLESSED BE! John Irving writes that a fiction writer's memory is an "especially imperfect provider of detail; we can always imagine a better detail than we can remember." The most truthful detail, he contends, is what  could  have happened, what  should  have happened.  Irving traces the beginning of his own writing career to a time when he and his friends mercilessly taunted the mentally retarded man who collected garbage on Front Street in his stately New Hampshire neighborhood, much to the dismay of John's prim and proper grandmother.  "Oink, oink," they would call as "Piggy" Sneed tossed the trash into the back of his rickety pickup, which was filled with pigs. Real pigs. Rumor had it that Piggy slept with the pigs in their pigpen. He never spoke but was said to snort and oink, just like his pigs.  When the local fire department's alarm sounded and a truck was dispatched to Piggy Sneed's pig farm, John, the youngest volunteer, could not believe it. The men joked on the way to the fire that Piggy would roast with his pigs because he was too stupid to escape. Hanging from the side of the truck and feeling the heat of the fire on his face as they approached Piggy's farm, John began to wonder who Piggy really was. And, he began to feel guilty about tormenting the man who'd never done anything to him.  Maybe he's not really retarded, John reasoned. Maybe he's saving money from the sale of his pigs to move to Florida, John suggested to the other firefighters. They just looked at him in disbelief. Or, John imagined, Piggy is from Europe or somewhere else and he doesn't speak English, that's why he never talks.  But as the flames grew hotter and engulfed the entire pigpen, it became apparent that Piggy could not possibly have survived, were he with his pigs that night as he usually was.  Not until they pulled Piggy's burned and blackened body from the fire did John relent. (Maybe he had family in Florida and was planning to join them there).  For Irving, writing became an endless journey of  Trying to Save Piggy Sneed , the title of his 1996 memoir. His stories and books are his attempts to rewrite history, to run back into that fire and pull Piggy out alive -- or to prevent the fire from starting in the first place.  A lifelong habit of writing stories has skewed my own sense of recall and reality. As a small child, I escaped my own fears by writing stories of triumph and perserverence and creating characters with courage and conviction. Before long, what  really  happened took second chair to what  should  have, what  could  have happened.  These days, as my beautiful friend Lynn fights for her own life and I watch, as helpless as John and the other men dangling from the sides of that fire truck, I am again grateful for the ability to write, rather than think, my way through things.  The real truth is that Lynn will be well, healed, cancer-free. What  should  be for her is health, peace, love and laughter. What  could  be for her is a world of endless possibilities. Lynn is the most loving, giving and gentle soul I've ever encountered. My brain does not even know how to begin thinking about what  is;  it is filled with stories of what should be, what could be.  As I sat talking with Lynn today after Day 2 of her week-long treatments, I took off my shoe and pointed to my foot. I'd absent-mindedly banged it on the desk while sitting at the computer writing. "Look," I said. "I've got a bruise."  The absurdity of my little bruise hit us simultaneously. There she sat, Band-Aids on both arms, exhausted and somewhat disoriented from the rigors of a quintuple dose of god-knows-what, gearing up for a mystery procedure on her head during Day 3. There I sat with a slightly bluish spot on my foot. We both burst out laughing.  "Aw," she said. "You've got an owie."  Yes, I do, I thought. And you're going to be fine. You're going to be well. You're going to live. Because if you weren't, I sure as hell would not be sitting here talking about my bruise. This week is filled with tests of strength and humanity for me.  My treatment regimen began with a bang so to speak. My dosage is 5x its normal amount and I will be entering guinea pig territory tomorrow...they will attempt to alleviate pressure in my head caused by a tumor that we can't seem to get control over.  I have no idea what shape all this medical crap will leave me in for my weekend adventure in NYC.  Will I have legs? I hope.  Will I be able to stand? I hope.  Will I be able to move? I hope.  Will the pain subside long enough for me to at least put on a good front so those that don't know me well will not see thru my facade...one where I am well and able.  Dream big dreams and hope for a bright tomorrow!  Blessed Be! When I lose my way or when I lose sight of my priorities, I turn to her words. The Invitation has changed my life and it feeds my soul and serves as such a means of inspiration and that all too important kick in the ass.    The Invitation   It doesnâ€™t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heartâ€™s longing.  It doesnâ€™t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love for your dream for the adventure of being alive.  It doesnâ€™t interest me what planets are squaring your moon... I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow if you have been opened by lifeâ€™s betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain.  I want to know if you can sit with pain mine or your own without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it.  I want to know if you can be with joy mine or your own if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful be realistic remember the limitations of being human.  It doesnâ€™t interest me if the story you are telling me  is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another  to be true to yourself. If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul. If you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.  I want to know if you can see Beauty even when it is not pretty every day. And if you can source your own life from its presence.  I want to know if you can live with failure yours and mine and still stand at the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, â€œYes.â€?  It doesnâ€™t interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair weary and bruised to the bone and do what needs to be done to feed the children.  It doesnâ€™t interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back.  It doesnâ€™t interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.  I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments. Morning all. Today needs to be a brand new day in every sense of the word.  I'm not sure how it will turn out but at least today, I have hope for a tomorrow.  I will leave you with Anastacia to begin your day.  Blessed Be!   Welcome to My Truth  ~Anastacia   Sentimental days  In a misty clouded haze  Of a memory that now feels untrue  I used to feel disguised  Now I leave the mask behind  Painting pictures that aren't so blue  The pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned   Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see  (Don't You Feel Sorry For Me)  My life turned around  But I'm still living my dreams  (Yes it's true I've been)  I've been through it all  Hit about a million walls  Welcome to my truth.. I still love  Welcome to my truth.. I still love   Tangled in a web  With a pain hard to forget  That was a time that I've now put to rest  Oh, the pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned   Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see  (Don't You Feel Sorry For Me)  My life turned around  But I'm still living my dreams  (Yes it's true I've been)  I've been through it all  Hit about a million walls  Welcome to my truth.. I still love  Welcome to my truth..

I still love  Welcome to my truth.. I still love Did you ever have one of those days that you would rather pluck your eyeballs out than go thru again? That was my day yesterday. Aside from the recently normal pain and cancer related crap, I got to leave something very dear to me as a means of self preservation. After over a year of one bastardizing slap in the face after another, it was just time. Did you ever encounter people who live for drama? Well, these people made my life like really bad community theater. There was all the name calling, reputation smudging and balls out innuendo of a good 70s camp movie. Much like a campy movie, these characters think they have a leg up or have gotten the better of you...now THAT is funny. I can just see the victory dance now - I hope it rains. BAH HAHAHAHAHAHA.  It was a day that makes you look and feel like this:    Now where is my coffee? The BEST thing to come from yesterday was the following quote I found while being frazzled from lack of clean air:  I've gone to look for myself. If I should return before I get back, keep me here. What on earth am I doing with a blog?? Well I'll tell you... In the last year or so, there have been so many misconceptions about me floating around... People think they know but they have no idea.  This also gives me the opportunity to discuss charities and life-works that matter to me.  That's why I'm here...how bout you?

ITS UNKNOWN: NaN==NaN. This is the 47th time. The tested sentence is:  This morning just after I got up, Maya called and wanted to know if I wanted to go shopping.  I had 2 be at work at 2, and she at 3.  So we went shopping around the C-20 area.  After we shopped around, we went and ate lunch at IHOP, I don't think I had ever been there before, but it was really good!  I had frech toast, eggs, and bacon :-D mmm mmm soo yummy  After dat, it was almost 1, so I was driving her back 2 her house and she was like, so how long do u think u and AJ will  be together for?  I was like I dunno.  She was like u dunno?  And I was like well, I really like him a lot, but with school starting we won't be able to see eachother as much and im not sure whats going to happen..  She said she was really serious about Brandon and she hopes to be with him 4 awhile if not forever, awww :-) Then I was like, oh u should ask AJ how long, so she said she would at work.  It was like 8ish and I almost forgot to see if Maya had asked AJ, she hadn't cuz she forgot, so she said she would ask him..  Well she said she asked him and he said he was really serious about me, and she said she told him it might be kinda hard with school since we go 2 different schools, and she said dat it would almost be long distance, and she said dat she and brandon were going to make it work, but she mentioned that we were younger, and AJ said dat we may be younger and not as experienced but he want's to learn with me :-D  awwwwww.  She said dat he was really serious about making things work and said dat we should double date more too.  YAY!  I was soo happy, lol.  I was like yeah were definately going to make things work :-D awwwww. Yesterday before work, I heard my friend Meghan talking about how she was swimming all these laps, trying to hold her breath for a long time.  It sounded like requirements for an sea world animal trainer, so I was like, what are you training for?  Sure enough she was training to be an animal trainer, at an aquarium in Miami, she would be doing seals, dolphins, and some other animals which I forgot..  I had so many questions because I too want to do something in that field.   I had wondered if she had a lot of previous experience with animals.  While she was in college she worked at Ripleys Aquarium in Myrtle Beach.   She went to Coastal Carollina College in Myrtle Beach, which is really cool, because thats one of the colleges on my list.  She said it was a great college, great party school, and she said there was ALWAYS tons to do, all night!  She said the shopping wasn'y great, but she said dat when she graduated two years ago, they were building the biggest mall in US!!!!  WOW, dats cool.  She said that u don't pay out of state tuition because Va doesn't have the major, Marine Biology.   She had a job for a year at an aquarium but her time ran out, so now she hopes to get a job in Miami.  They gave her the test requirements, which includes 50 push ups, and swimming 1 lap underwater and a bunch of other stuff.  After she trains enough she is going to go take the test!  I just thought it was soo cool!!! LOL Today Maya, Brandon, AJ, and I planned a double date for today (we all work together), we had planned to invite a bunch of other peoples from work, but they were unable to come except for Alexis- 1 of Maya's good friends.. Well today I was like well if the date doesn't go really good today, im gonna have to question how good being in a relationship w/AJ is right now.  I picked AJ up at 1:00, we planned to see AVP at 2:00, so Maya, Brandon, and Alexis were going to meet us at the movies around 1:30. Well... They were a lil late so we got tickets to the 3:30 show and drove up to target to get some candy 2 sneak in2 the movies. I got skittles and a strawberry drink- wanted to get my breath fruity, lol.. Maya got a 2 liter of gingerale to bring to the movies! LOL it was so funny, and we were like if they tell us we can't bring it in we were just going 2 tell them we were taking it to the break room, lol right...  The movie was pretty good. AJ said it wasn't bloody enough, lol- Im glad it wasn't! AJ tried to do more than just cuddling and kissing,but I didn't let him, though Maya and Brandon were doing sumthin, lol, I think anything farther than kissing should definately be only when it's the two of us. AJ was doing some new things that were awesome that made me wonder, dang whos he been making out with, getting tips from? lol seriously.  After the movie, we all piled in2 my car and went to Rockwood Park where Maya though there was go karting- but turned out they didn't have any go carts. So we ended up going to this put put place in midlothian which had go karts.. They were so much fun! Brandon made AJ spin out, it was funny!  After go karting,we were hungry but we didn't want dinner, we wanted dessert. So we drove to fridays, but they had like a 20 minute wait and we didn't feel like waiting so we wen't to coldstone creamery instead, ohh I love dat place! I got birthday cake remix and it was really good. After we ate Brandon was like come here Maya I wanna talk 2 u, and they were walking really close to this big fountain that sprays from the ground and I was like ohhh hes so gonna throw her in, and he picked her up and she fell in!! I was like omg! And like half of her jeans were soaked! AJ was like I would throw u in but ur wearing white, I was like haha! After Brandon threw Maya in the fountain every1 was throwing water at eachother and we had a water fight, it was fun, lol.  After the water fight, Maya was like lets go play hide and go seek behind the movie theater. So we were walking back to the car and Brandon and AJ were goofing off taking there time so Maya was like lets go lock the guys outa the car, so we ran and got in the car and locked the doors, and pretended to start driving off, it was soo funny! AJ climbed on top of the car and it was hilarious, and Brandon was on the back of the car making the car go up and down. Finally we let them in, but only cuz we wanted to go play hide and seek.  So we got to the theater and played hide and seek. AJ had a "brilliant" idea to hide in these shrub bushes down this steep hill, I was like dats okay, haha he came out with thorn thingys all over him,aww, lol. We stayed til 9pm then we decided we should get home. I had to work night shift yesterday (5:30-close), and AJ had to work too except 3:30-8:30. Well I had to be in concession while he got to usher, lucky... Well, it didn't even seem like AJ was working yesterday, he was never around and he barely even said hi, well thats typical when were at work, cuz he doesn't want people talking, and I totally understand, but still its kinda frusterating, I mean hes sooo different when were at work, but people do tease us alot, so yeah. Well, Jessie the head guy in concession told me to go on break at 8:30, I was like cool I can say hi 2 AJ cuz he'll be getting off work, well he was kinda "busy" trying to find Tara (such a slut) to give back her pen. He said he would call me tomorrow (today) but he said he had band camp. Then Sam was going out the side doors and he ran to catch up w/her and he left and went out the door (nope, didn't say bye or anything), Heather was like, ohhh if dat was my boyfriend I would so break up w/him. she was like hes such an ass, and she was saying stuff like dat. I mean yeah he sometimes pisses me off at work n stuff, but dats at work, we can't do anything at work anyways. She was like u should really talk 2 him about it. well it was soon time to go back to concession and a few min later Heather came 2 say hi, I was like, so what should I say? and she was like call him up and be like "u didn't say bye to me bitch" and hang up, she said it would scare him. lol, I was like rite.. Then Jessie heard her say dat and was like, what? and I was like oh nothing, he was like no tell, me. I was like well AJs kinda been pissing me off, and he was like why, and stuff, and he said I should talk to him about it. I dunno tho, I don't think I'll worry about it too much, I think I'll just give him his space at work, and I have my own friends to chill w/at work, and yes they are guys, hahaha, lol. I don't want summer to end.  I have had such a great summer.  I went to Sea World camp in San Antonio Texas in june, which was a total blast!  I had so much fun, though I think back about how we had to get up at like 6am every morning, and I don't know how I did it, I still wanna go back next year though.  I met this really nice guy from work AJ, just a few days before leaving for violin camp which would last 2 weeks, I thought about him alot while I was at camp, and I couldn't wait to see him again when I got back, but violin camp was so much fun, and I met some really cool people, like Ally and Geni!!!     Well, I went back to work on saturday, and yay!  I got to see AJ (he was working saturday too).  We talked alot and he ended up asking me out on monday (July 12).- we have been going out since :-)   The last week of July I went to the beach for a week, I wished that AJ could have came- haha lol yeah right, like that would ever happen :-D, but I had still had a fun week, even though AJ wasn't there.  I bought a surf board the first day- I had checked about renting one, but it would cost 20 bucks a day and it was cheaper to buy one for 100 bucks.  I had went to a surf camp last year, so im not a complete beginner at surfing, lol.      So yeah, thats been my summer, going to sea world camp, violin camp, and the beach, and spending time with my friends and my boyfriend.- I don't want it to end!  Right now I get to see my bf several times a week, outside of work, we'll go to the movies, or I'll go to his house or he'll come to mine.  Im worried that when school starts we won't get to see eachother as much, but I hope we can make things work, and I know I wan't to, I just hope it all works out with us going to different schools and stuff :-/ YAY!  I drove up to Virginia Beach w/dad to look at a 94 Toyota Paseo.  It was super cute, lol, and it was cool.  I got to take it for a test drive, and I loved the way it drove, it was easy to drive and easy to see out of.  It has a lot of things I like, like it's 2 door, and it has a sun roof and it has a CD player w/great sound system- it can go super loud :-D !! My dad had some complaints tho- like the windshield had a scratch from the windshield wipers and he said he would have to get it changed.  But finally he said I could get it!  YAY.  I got to drive it home, but it was kinda annoying cuz it was rainning really hard, and I couldn't go very fast- darn, lol, but I got to use the CD player and I listened to my Avril CD the whole way back, it got kinda annoying- the same thing 4 almost 3 hours, but it was the only CD I had in the car w/me- my other CDs were w/my dad in his car.   -I prob won't be able to drive itr anywhere til friday :-( cuz it has to get licensed first, and it stupidly is in my dads name so I can't get it licensed, only he can.  awww, I wanna drive AJ around in my car, lol.

And so began our travels To test frigid cold waters  To burn our scorching pyres He took the lead and as I watched  Him gripping, staring, standing, speaking I never did imagine such A beautiful human being  Though regularly sentimental His rigid masculine form moreso His lips moved with a pout That burned my skin I fumbled about  I felt his hands define The contours of my mind  As each bewildering caress Succeeded melting my fortress No more could I protect it From my ardent fueling fires He ruled with such intensity With careful thorough steps His eyes reflected clearer skies Did I seem to surmise? For each of his inured controlled And tempered stroke  Inwardly, savagely, pleasurably Filled and completed me. The pale shadow disappears at dawn Will he return again to fill the void?  As memories of rides and times  Play on one's conflicted mind  My thin nimble fingers run through The soft grass of your hair  The sensitive palm of my hand Recalls the shores   Of glassy waters I found   Within the hearth of your neck  And learn I did of men Strong therefore resonant  Their profiles hide in soft  Unclaimed corners and calming tides  Valleys of your hills through Vastness of your mountains  I trek as midst of  My weary soft body  Traversely hike to Hunt your adrift desires Here's something I wrote in random. I dedicate this to you.   Let me be your music's song and sing your heart's melody. Let me be the petals of the bud that's growing in your heart. Sing I may not of your true love's hymn. And grow I must not for your garden's room. But here I, with you sing and bloom For I am and will be love's instrument to your song Where there're eagles that soar on high lands occupied by inhabitable mountains iced and blue from its sparkles freezing the sky in a quiet zone.  This land of fragrant pines touch the brown earth's wondrous floor as the heavily pregnant ocean gives life to its child sending salt and wind of her waters for a redolent fertile soil.  This land, and the sky, and the seas of earth's bounty find the garden in my soul for your love has brought them to what was unknowingly surreal.  My corrupted polluted heart stopped its thunderous beat from the moment the windows on the house of my being unhurriedly, leisurely, though tensely be unlocked and found sight of you.   - originally written in February 2004 He catches me falling from my skies But then I am buried deep in his eyes I sink tho' in the waves and Clear waters of burning desires  As the coals of my heart Burn inflamed of these fires I want to lose myself in you Or you bury yourself in me I want to exchange dreams Of endless and tireless hunts I want to sink my body deep Or you sink to touch my pit Where the waters of my well Flood the timber of your desires.  I long to explore your hidden waves Or you explore my needy tides As our heated forms collapse We break and crumble into sand I want to be washed by your waters Or you be dribbled by my flow Of ebbs and tides we shall share The waterfalls of our desires. Spring nights when shorebirds sing In the still of the cold evening Short of darkness through mellow Dim and grayish blue clouds Graze the sky in flocks of new  Think heavens lie beyond Those fires of orange, red And purple hues  Yellow pale and brown Airborne birds seek home In lonely trees come when 'Tis roots of sinewy blue Come alive risen by their coos I want to kiss your mouth and have my tongue explore its depth.  I want you to kiss me back, soft and feathery at first and later as the warmth traces your loins, your kisses become hurried and hungry for more.  It will be hard to choose between who gives and who receives because we both want to do the same.  So we leave it to the moment as we allow our bodies to speak in an untested foreign language of love...   -  Ylang2   Reflection lights the river Spat by wispy rays of A full luminous moon  When the somber night Hushed loversâ€™ wails Only to send ripples on waters Unsettling â€˜tis clear portrait   But they heave to meet Both heightened bliss Cuffing their wallowing Aches with every lash Two warm bodies Collapse, heaped on a  Lone surmountable shay    We sit on this place, I call it a chaise... we make love on its limited  space, our bodies curl and intertwine, until it is transformed into one. We'd both be so spent by the end of the evening that we'd hardly be able to talk.  We wouldn't need to.  We'd be conversing with our eyes.    - SB   These are my uncomplicated desires.   I want a man who has the time and patience  to explore and discover the hidden secrets of my body.      Because I am on my way to middle age,  I am terrified at the thought  of hormonal imbalances and the pull  of earthâ€™s gravity taking its toll on my once  dense and voluptuous body.    I am afraid of losing my sensitivity  to touch that has become routine  and without inventiveness, therefore  I want a man who will love to caress and  sensitize my soft skin, a man  not afraid of going into raptures at,  not failing to mention the femininity of my being.    I want to feel the approval and adoration  of a man as he affectionately  traces my bodyâ€™s physical imperfections.   And as he brings me to climax I  will hold on tight, pulling him even closer to  bite his neck and his shoulders, releasing  moans of pleasure while he watches  the afterglow of my skin as he  takes pride in his complete manhood.    I want to die and be resurrected again. As you lay  You breathe Into my heart  Tepid air as you exhale  A quiet moan escapes To call your god's name Taking the pleasure  I sustain  For every longing  In your waiting You speak to me  Of your desire  The fueling fires left By lost sighs Of long ago  From passion's youth  You moan and crave And follow suit Then as I hear  You calling  For my wise And skillful mastery To singe the dire Needs obvious   To my eyes You telling  Me a wanting vice To drench your scorching pyres  By waters from My own desires And like an angry Stallionâ€™s howl  Succumbing freely Giving in to me  Again you breathe Again you lay  I hear you softly  Heat satiating from My tendering  You so acclaim  Only to hear  you  Whisper  but her name... by Steve B.   A delicate scent lingers in my memory An exotic fragrance from a tropical land Warm sand with gentle surf  Line the shores of the islands in my dream.  I am not alone, in this dream A sensual creature,  A warm and sharing lover,  Holds me.   Together we explore,  Discover and create  We remain connected  Over miles of ocean,  Forest and mountain Our grip is firm, yet gentle We smile And continue our lives Climb I will those mountaintops Of cold and sharp plateaus Deep I swim the vague oceans  Of unsettling breaking currents Wade through I the dense green forests Of dark and shady woods  But love ascertained  Is life endured  And love existed Will be subsisted  In no way you will ebb like tides Nor come down from the soaring sky Not stay inside my forests fires But breathe to live and as I die this love can thus revive.

A superficial snowfall is seemingly what  This floating efflorescence suggests   Where the scorching dry sun  Creates a mirage of dissolving  Particles in aqueous ground  An oasis on the paved cemented bed     I eagerly thirst  For sheer waters of spring   Where above its concrete surface Blurry vapours rise slow  Moving in transparent waves A motion of see-through fiery glass  Where this nameless seasonâ€™s beauty In you, with you, from you White as linen in pureness In your rare singular soul   I am in heat For your eager touch   Where the sun in its spectacle  Of light and vital energy  Its powerful rays capture Your handsome physical form  Where your smooth blanket of skin Drape my untanned stark form Sending sparks of the summer heat My tempered soul calmed by your winter song   I am then recast  I am in awe In a dreamlike trance Bewildered by your glow

"you can't fake ir hard enough to please, everyone, or anyone at all..."      and i can NOT fake it that well. i may put on a facade. because i hear it all the time.      "you're fine. you're a teenager. you're SUPPOSED to go through this..."   i am...?   since when...?      tell me when YOU lost all of your friends because of conformity?   tell me when YOU had someone tell you that you deserved every bit of pain they put you through?   has an entire group of people ever made u feel like u dont deserve to live?   have they told you that you are worthless?      i wake up every morning to a constant reminder of what i don't have...and what i never will have...      "and the grave that you refuse to leave, the refuge that you built to flee, the places you have come to fear the most, it's the place that you have come to fear that most..."      the world needs more people like matt. yes matt. i love matt. he is my hero. no one can make me laugh quite like he can.      the world needs more people like sally. sally can put fun into anything.      the world needs more people like winny. not many people understands like she does.      the world needs more people....like every person i have ever turnt to...and by that i mean every person i met this summer.   i would die for you all.   i would give anything to spend forever with you guys.      the world needs more people like emory...    beautiful, soft eyed, caring, funny, wonderful people like emory...    ...i need more people like emory in my world...but i will settle for the original.   i dont like knock offs.    i want him.      the boogie man lives in mine and matts closets...mine irons my clothes...matts burns em for fire and make him get supplies for smores...me and that boogie man are gonna have a duel for the closet when i get there...    DIE BOOGIE!!! we've decided that everyone in LCP has ADD: advanced drama disorder.   we were sitting there today discussing our first performance, and all of a sudden breanna and aaron were fighting over a tennis ball.      20 minutes later...   a shoe went flying across the theater...   makes you wonder why MORE people aren't in drama...      we're finally getting somewhere though: we have a skit to do friday morning for the frosh. yah fun.      i got my schedule today.   english with burhman, LCP, history with taitano, art with yori, algebra with deruse, chem with rice...   at least i didnt get moses. that old asshole. all i did in that class was text brad....anywho...      i have started formulating my "dillenger escape plan" and i found today that it will cost quite a lovely chunk of change. this is bad news...      however...      i get to live with winny...next to ludacris...thats right bitches...fuck you.   also...chrissy and i are moving to - thats right -  CANADIA        ..............eh?............. a stand still romance. yet there's no sure way to be so true. no sure way to stop from falling into you. no sure way to know that you play your words so well. pick them wisely, not a soul to tell. perhaps who knows what's going on tonight. i see another facade of myself putting up a useless fight. useless to be that this could be real. useless to be that i couldn't feel. a stand still romance in my eyes you are. i shake my head in a pitiful attempt to not think that far. a stop and go feeling is whats going on. nothing to stand still for nothing to linger on. a broken view of everything she could have here. and a stand still vision of everything that there is to fear.        i love a boy from texas...        apparently there's this thing called distance.    apparently there's this thing called being hurt.   not being able to trust again when someone says "i love you."      apparently, they tell me  i need you... all hail mr. leo mcbride, for he is the shit.         i am extremely bored right now, for there is not one thing to do. damn.   matt left me. to go to bed or something. it's only 3 am in DC. he can make it another hour or 2...Winny is sleeping she has soccer tryouts tomorrow...emory is in germany...sally is grounded and god knows where the hell ryan is. holly is sleeping as well. bastards. suck it up and drink some coffee.      so i have this thing for LCP (learning curve productions) all this week at school. we thought it was supposed to be fun. barrett and i have found that to be just a tad bit short of true. we just kinda of sit...while he yells...it's entertaining though.      i have directions on how to get to washington DC for my "dillenger escape plan" and i plan on stopping in nebraska to pick up some rocks and a stuffed jack rabbit. stuffed for safty percautions of course. i love matt. he is my god of fuck.      i have decided that this escape plan of which i speak will go through sometime soon if i stay here. i do not like it here. i wake up everyday knowing that when i look at everything in this world some like to call "home" i am reminded of everything that has been fucked up for me. i hate you people. if you are my friend, you know it. if not, suck on this. i really wish i could also move to DC...or Texas...or Miami...i just want to be with the person i love...      ooh...and i have a new crush...but i won't tell...    C'MON...  you really can't be THAT stupid?

Today was so boring....I go to school, period after period and bla bla bla.....But ______ is the one who make it from a boring day to the WORSEST DAY IN HELL. He is such a MORON. He tends to play with other people's father name without knowing whether the person like it or not. I admit that i like him at first becuz he is okey then. But now, after i have seen his attitude, i kinda HATE HIM TO THE CORE. Its just the why can't he just behave llike other sane human beings. It suits him if he is a quiet guy sitting at one corner doing his work. But now, things have chang. I don't like him anymore and nothing he does can change what i think about him anymore.....I am a serious person when it comes to relationships....BEWARE!! today is soooo unusual.....donno why but just UNUSUAL, dats all.

So, natasha said that she is with me at century sq doing some shopping. Den this is what he said, " ook, fine. Whateva. You alwayz listen to ur so called 'good friend'. WHO is he to say that to me. Natasha doesn't even like him, that GOOD FOR NOTHING JERK!! If i could, i would spit at his face that natasha is just using him..You gotta see the look on his face if i say this to him but i kept a promise to natasha to not tell him. So i kept my finers crossed. I HATE THE SIGHT OF HIM!! ARGH!!!! As you know, today is GOOD FRIDAY, and do you know what it means??......it means that today is a HOLIDAY, silly(to people who do not know what it means). I'm DYING of boredness....

Not only weird but irritating. my brother was sleeping so comfortably with his saliva coming out of his mouth in his bed at 6.58 p.m. suddenly, my granny shouted at him to wake up as seh said this, " ITS NOT GOOD TO SLEEP IN THE AFTERNOON".

Betrayal Betrayal is hurtful and also the devil because it is always full of pure evil It lies within you...whether you want to make it happen or not it makes your stomach churn and always leaves a knot  Betrayal has no trust in it That's why couples were against it it leaves a hutful scar you'd be sitting there with your mouth ajar cuz your ties have broken with her regreting the days you spent together  Betrayal does not come like that It's you, it's YOU who make it happen..... Guess what? I'M REALLY GOING TO WIL WILD WET!!! I can't believe it....it's gonna be a blast...BUT unfortunately, my sister can't go cuz she's working..that's too bad...and my father will meet us there at 4:00p.m cuz HE ALSO HAS TO WORK!!!

I totally feel  urlLink    shattered.....It's ok, i'll get over it...  urlLink HoLA everybody!! I am gonna introduce to you one of the love poems i wrote....Please enjoy them with the beutiful classical music... A Life With Love Love can be complicated yet, nothing is as beutiful as love love is also soft and delicate like the swaying motions of a dove  If you make one silly mistake your love is already at stake Betrayal and trust are the two sides undiscovered You would alyays end up unhurt or perhaps severed  Trust is earned not bought it is an obstacle made by two which their minds chose to be thought To trust somebody is not a difficult thing to do  As love always comes from the heart And nothing can make it depart...
